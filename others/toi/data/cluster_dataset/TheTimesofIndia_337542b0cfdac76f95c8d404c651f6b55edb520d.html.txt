 I-League champions
Churchill Brothers will face the winners of the match between Syrian side Al
Karamah and Al Wahda of UAE in the play-off clash on February 6 to qualify for
the prestigious AFC Champions League 2010. 

 Churchill were lucky to
get a bye in the three-team West Asian group as they will play only one match in
the ACL play-offs. Al Karamah and Al Wahda will face off on January 30,
according to the ACL draw announced. 

 The venues of the matches will
be announced later. Even if Churchill qualify for the 32-team ACL, they will be
clubbed in Group B along with two-time champions and 2009 runners-up Al Ittihad
of Saudi Arabia, Iran's Zob Ahan, big-spending Bunyodkor of Uzbekistan, which
virtually is a Group of Death. 

 The winner of East Asian group
play-offs among Singapore Armed Forces, Sriwijaya of Indonesia, Da Nang of
Vietnam and Muangthong of Thailand will be clubbed in Group G along with 2008
ACL champions Gamba Osaka of Japan, newcomers Henan Jianye of China and Korean
FA Cup winners Suwon Bluewings.

 The play-off match will not be easy
for Churchill as both the West Asian sides are strong teams. 

 Al
Karamah were the 2006 ACL runners-up side and 2009 AFC Cup runners-up. Indian
side Mohun Bagan lost both their home and away matches against Al Karamah in the
2009 AFC Cup. 

 Al Wahda had appeared in the Asian Champions League
four times in the past as recently as 2008 and they were the semi-finalists in
2007. 

 If Churchill lose in the play-off match, they will play in the
AFC Cup. The same is the case for all the other losing teams in the
play-offs.
