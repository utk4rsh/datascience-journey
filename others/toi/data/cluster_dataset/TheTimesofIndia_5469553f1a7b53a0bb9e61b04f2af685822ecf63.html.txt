 Traditional cricketing
rivals India and Pakistan, having met with a disastrous fate in World Cup 2007,
could now exchange notes on how to improve their game. This advice came on
Tuesday from Pakistani Premier Shaukat Aziz on the sidelines of the 14th SAARC
Summit in the Capital.

 “In cricket we can only get better. I
think the performance of the two teams leaves a lot to be desired. Perhaps the
two cricket boards should consult each other on how to do things and how not
to,” Aziz said in an interaction with editors.

 The poor
performance of the Indian and Pakistani teams, otherwise considered to be
cricketing heavyweights, weighed heavily on the mind of the Pakistani Prime
Minister as he drew an analogy between cricket and SAARC.

 “We
(SAARC) need to score more runs,” Aziz said in his opening remarks as he
addressed the editors.

 He, however, promptly quipped that
“cricket may not be the best analogy for some of us,” clearly
referring to the early exit of India and Pakistan from the World Cup being
played in West Indies.

 Pakistan has also found itself embroiled in a
controversy, with its coach Bob Woolmer found dead in his hotel room shortly
after the team's exit from the World Cup.

 Bangladesh and Sri Lanka,
both of which beat India in the initial round of the World Cup, resulting in its
ouster, are the two countries from South Asia that are still in the fray for the
biggest cricket trophy.
