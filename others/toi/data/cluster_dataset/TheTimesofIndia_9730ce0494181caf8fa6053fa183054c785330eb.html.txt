 The seven IITs have asked the
HRD ministry to reserve 25% post-graduate seats and 10% faculty posts for
foreigners. The idea to introduce reservations for foreigners was mooted after
all the seven directors agreed that having a mix of "unlike minds with different
backgrounds" will work towards enhancing the academic environment on
campuses.

 IIT-Madras director M S Ananth, who heads a sub-group to
chart out the implementation on 27% OBC reservations, told TOI,"encouraging
foreign students will allow better academic exchange."

 The current
total strength for P-G courses at the IITs is 804, but not all the seats get
taken up. While former education secretary Sudip Banerjee was amenable to the
idea of allowing foreign students in principle, the ministry wanted seats set
aside for foreigners over and above the current total intake of post-graduate
students, so that Indians were not deprived of allotments.

 Sources
said the question of reservations over and above the current intake does not
arise as several seats go vacant even now. Sources in the ministry say the
proposal, in its present shape, is waiting for a final nod. This is not the
first initiative aimed at widening the pool of students. In fact, to draw talent
from overseas, the IITs have also announced setting up jee centres in Singapore
and West Asia. 

 As part of the expansion plan to accommodate 27% OBC
students, campuses will require 1,200-1,500 more faculty members. Officials hope
to meet some of the demand by recruiting abroad. "Teachers from eastern Europe
are willing to come here and work with us. We have spoken to the HRD ministry to
simplify rules in letting them come here," said Surendra Prasad, IIT-Delhi
director.
