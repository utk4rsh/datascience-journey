 Having let the opposition off
the hook in their last two matches, Mumbai will have a tough task in hand when
they take on group toppers Tamil Nadu, sans two of its key players, in a crucial
sixth round Elite division Group A Ranji Trophy encounter beginning on Tuesday.


 The hosts so far have failed to deliver the killing blow which have
cost them as many as three outright wins against Punjab, Railways and Hyderabad.


 Even though they managed to make it to the quarter-finals based on
their first innings leads, on all the three matches, Mumbai bowlers failed to
bowl out the opposition on the last day, despite having them on the mat.


 Adding to the home team's woes is the absence of pacer Ajit Agarkar
and middle-order batsman Rohit Sharma. While Agarkar is injured, Sharma has been
named in the Indian squad that will be playing Twenty20 International against
Sri Lanka. 

 With the duo missing, the onus would be on opener Ajinkya
Rahane who returned to form with an unbeaten 265 against Hyderabad. Skipper
Wasim Jaffer also has been consistent through out and already has two centuries
to his name in the season and the team will expect an encore from him as a good
show will guarantee the hosts a spot in the next round. 

 Tamil Nadu,
meanwhile, are sitting pretty at the top of the table with 20 points in five
matches and with the return of opener Murali Vijay, they will look to
consolidate their position with a clinical performance on
Tuesday.

 But the visitors will miss spinner R Ashwin, who will join
the Indian team for Twenty20 matches against Sri Lanka.
