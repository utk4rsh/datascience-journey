 Addressing a meeting of the
Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), Mukherjee said:
"Security has been a concern... There are multidimensional challenges before
us." 

 He pointed out that "terrorists from Pakistan" had targeted
"financial centres" and the economy. 

 "Medical centres, aviation and
infrastructures have not been spared. In recent times India has become a victim
of terrorism including cross border terrorism. The 26/11 attacks was one such
gruesome example. This needs to be tackled in a resolute manner. We will spare
no efforts to deal with terrorists."
