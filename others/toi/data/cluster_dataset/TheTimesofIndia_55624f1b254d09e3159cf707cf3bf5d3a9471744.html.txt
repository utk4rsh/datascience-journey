 Former India captain Sourav
Ganguly's well-compiled 66 could not rescue Bengal who were shot out for a
paltry 193 by Uttar Pradesh on the opening day of their Ranji Trophy Super
League Group B match on Tuesday.

 Batting at number five after UP
captain Mohammad Kaif had inserted Bengal, Ganguly steadied his side's innings
after they were reduced to 20 for three within the first hour.


 Opener Deep Dasgupta was out in the first over for a duck while
wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha and Manoj Tiwary fell for seven and one
respectively, in quick succession. 

 Ganguly, who hit nine fours and a
six from the 123 balls he faced, shared an 81-run partnership for the fourth
wicket with opener Arindam Das (46) to raise the hope of a revival.


 Later, captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla made a useful 64-ball 39, with the
help of three fours and two sixes, to stretch the Bengal total near the
200-mark. 

 For Uttar Pradesh, leg-spinner Piyush Chawla and pacer
Praveen Kumar shared the spoils with seven wickets among them. Chawla returned
figures of four for 51 while Kumar took three for wickets for 54 runs. RP Singh
chipped in with 2/37. 

 In reply, Uttar Pradesh did not open account
in the four balls they face before stumps. Tanmay Srivastava and Shivakant
Shukla were both on zero.
