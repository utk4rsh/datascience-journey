 Tamil Nadu skipper Dinesh
Karthik slammed a blistering 152 as the visitors gained three points, courtesy
their 34-run first innings lead, from their drawn Ranji Trophy Super League
Group A match against Orissa on Thursday. 

 Orissa had to be satisfied
with just a lone point from the stalemate. 

 With no real result in
sight, Tamil Nadu batsmen went for some batting practice and Karthik shone with
a 157-ball 152 that had 19 fours and two sixes in it. 

 Anirudha
Srikkanth (81), son of former India captain and current chief selector K
Srikkanth, and Arun Kartik (19) added 66 runs for the opening pair before Alok
Sahoo removed the latter. 

 Abhinav Mukund (9) did not last long
either but that brought in Karthik, who, in Srikkanth's company, went after the
Orissa bowlers. 

 Srikkanth looked good for his ton but the youngster
fell 19 runs away from the mark. His 93 ball 81 had 12 fours in it.


 Tamil Nadu were 379 for eight at stumps. For Orissa, Dhiraj Singh
claimed three for 122, while Sahoo (2/56) and Rakesh Mohanty (2/79) got two
apiece. 

 Brief score: Tamil Nadu : 361 & 375 for 8. Orissa:
327.
