 Saili Rane and Sara Naqvi
benefitted from a Nepali shuttler's last minute withdrawal while PV Sindhu and
Juhi Dewangan notched up contrasting wins to reach the women's singles main draw
of the Syed Modi International Grand Prix Badminton Tournament on Tuesday.


 Sindhu thrashed Rucha Nikam 21-6, 21-9 in 14 minute, while Juhi beat
Shivalaya Gupta 21-19, 21-11 in 20 minutes at the UPBA Academy here to make it
to the main draw. 

 Sara was supposed to play her qualifying match
against Saili Rane of Maharashtra but a last minute withdrawal by a Nepali
shuttler cleared her and Rane's ways to the main draw. 

 Another
Indian, Rachita Sahdev, also qualified for the main draw after getting a bye.


 The main draw of the six-day $50,000 tournament starts tomorrow with
top Indian shuttlers Saina Nehwal and Chetan Anand in the fray.


 However, the mixed doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and V Diju, who were
top seeded here, withdrew last evening owing to the Hyderabadi girl's foot
infection. 

 Organising secretary Vijai Sinha said Gutta has confirmed
her presence at the tournament on Friday to attend her felicitation ceremony.


 "She has agreed to come for the felicitation ceremony and would also
attend the final day's proceedings too," said Sinha.
