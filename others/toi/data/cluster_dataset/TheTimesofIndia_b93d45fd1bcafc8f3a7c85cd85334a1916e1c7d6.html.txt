
A day after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistan president Pervez
Musharraf agreed in Havana to resume talks and set up an anti-terrorism
mechanism, the decision evoked mixed responses in Jammu and Kashmir.


 While several separatist and
mainstream leaders welcomed the decision, the common people wanted an end to
violence before the proposed
talks.

 Senior Hurriyat leader
Molvi Abbas Ansari said, "It is good but much more needs to be done to involve
the Kashmiri leadership in the talks. Besides, the Centre should reduce troops
from J&K, so that improvement is visible on the
ground."

 While welcoming the
move, JKLF chief Yaseen Malik said the talks should lead to a permanent solution
to the Kashmir issue. Senior PDP leader Muzaffar Hussian Beig said, "This will
reduce the violence in the state, if not eradicate it for the time being. The
two countries need to ensure that no fresh infiltration takes place in the
state."
