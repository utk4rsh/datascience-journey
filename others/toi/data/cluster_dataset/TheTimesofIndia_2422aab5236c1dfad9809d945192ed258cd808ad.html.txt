 Justine Henin lauded
compatriot Kim Clijsters on Tuesday for her stunning victory at the U.S. Open
amid speculation the former No. 1 might also announce a return to the circuit
soon. 

 Using her competition Web site for the first time in over 5
months, Henin said that "what you have come to achieve there is incredible."


 "I very warmly congratulate you with your magnificent victory," she
wrote. 

 Having played barely a month on the tour after 2 1/2 years in
retirement, Clijsters won the U.S. Open on Sunday, beating both Venus and Serena
Williams on the way to the final. 

 Up to a few months ago, Henin
seemed totally happy in retirement too, but has not made any efforts recently to
quash rumors to the contrary. Only last week, she refused to discuss her
possible return. 

 On Tuesday, her spokesperson did not return calls
to discuss the issue. 

 The RTBF television network reported that
Henin had recently bought 14 rackets and would make a public announcement soon.


 Last year, Henin shocked the tennis world by announcing her
retirement while still ranked No. 1. In May, she complained that the sport had
left her with so many physical pains a return was unthinkable. 

 Yet
she was seen training again recently, apparently all for a small exhibition
tournament in the southern city of Charleroi, one she has played in regularly
during the December winter break.
