 A day after top Al Qaida commander Mustafa Abu Al Yazid warned India of
more Mumbai-like strikes if it tried to attack Pakistan, National Security Guard
(NSG) chief J K Dutt on Wednesday said 26/11 was a joint operation of Taliban,
Al Qaida and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).

 "The Mumbai terror attack was an
audacious attempt by the LeT, Taliban and Al Qaida combine to shape policies of
three sovereign nations that include the oldest and the largest democracy," Dutt
said at an international seminar organised by the National Bomb Data Centre at
Manesar in Haryana.

 "There is growing concern over convergence of the
objectives of terrorist organisations such as Al Qaida and LeT. The Mumbai
terror attack represents this convergence of interests," Dutt
said.

 The NSG chief, who oversaw commando operations during the
Mumbai strikes, however, found himself in a spot when his comments were aired by
TV channels, indicating how his comment was the first instance of someone
pointing to a Taliban-Qaida link to 26/11.

 Dutt immediately got into
damage control mode and clarified to reporters that his comments were made in
the context of global scenario of terrorism.

 "With the resurgence of
Taliban, the region astride the Durand Line â€” the international border
between Pakistan and Afghanistan -- appears to be spiralling out of control. The
LeT has morphed from a Kashmir-centric terror group to a transnational terror
group that aspires to fight jihad across the globe," he said.
