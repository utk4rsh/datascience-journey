
Admitting to a 'trust deficit' with Pakistan, PM Manmohan Singh said there was
no alternative to carrying forward the dialogue. "There has been a trust
deficit, but we cannot stand still," he
said.

 Singh countered BJP's
criticism, and more particularly the view of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee that
the Havana proposal was a "conspiracy", by pointing out that NDA regime had also
chosen to engage Musharraf after the Kargil war.


 Later, Vajpayee had also
visited Pakistan in 2004. He made this point to buttress his view that his talks
were hardly breaking new
ground.

 Asked about the
prospects of such a dialogue when Musharraf had dismissed the Line of Control as
border, the PM said that despite the position taken by the Pakistani leader a
way had to be found to keep the talks going. "We have to hold dialogue to end
terrorism," he said.

 Responding
to a question about autonomy and self-rule for Jammu and Kashmir, he said that
every issue concerning the state was being discussed with the people. Singh
pointed out that Constitution had enough built-in flexibility to meet the
legitimate aspirations of the people.
