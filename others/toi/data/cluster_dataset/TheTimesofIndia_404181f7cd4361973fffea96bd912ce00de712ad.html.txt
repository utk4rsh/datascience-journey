 Making an emotional speech at the SAARC summit, Nepal Prime Minister
Girija Prasad Koirala on Monday said that he had gambled his 60 years of
political career to bring peace to the Himalyan
country.

 "I have gambled 60
years of my political career, now the situation has calmed down and they
(Maoists) have come within the democratic framework," he said at the inaugural
session of the 14th SAARC summit in New
Delhi.

 Koirala recalled how he
strongly felt the need for a dialogue with the Maoist rebels to end the
decade-long armed conflict.

 "I
wanted to have a dialogue with the Maoists but was told by many that 'terrorists
are not to be believed'," he
said.

 Koirala said that being a
democrat he could not be merely a silent
spectator.

 "I thought, if I
fail, the nation should not fail as it would be my personal loss, I gambled 60
years of my political career," he
said.

 "We have managed to bring
the Maoists to the mainstream. A new chapter is going on in Nepal," he
said.

 Noting that a new
government has been formed in Nepal, which includes the Maoists, Koirala said
the constituent assembly elections will soon be held in the Himalayan
country.

 He described the
inclusion of Afghanistan into SAARC and presence of international observers at
the summit meeting as two major milestones in the history of the regional
grouping.

 The SAARC should
focus on poverty alleviation and exploit the region's resources to achieve the
objective.
