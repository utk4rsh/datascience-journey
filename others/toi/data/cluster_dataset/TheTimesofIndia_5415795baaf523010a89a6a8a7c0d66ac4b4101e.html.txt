 Pakistani Taliban have
decided to target the federal capital in retaliation for military operations
against it in Darra Adam Khel and Swat valley in the country's northwest,
according to a media report on Wednesday. 

 Graffiti about the
Taliban's move has already appeared on walls in Islamabad, forcing the
administration to whitewash these messages. Many religious scholars in Islamabad
have been warned by the Taliban that they have only two options â€” to
support the militants or leave the city, The News daily reported. 

 If
the clerics fail to choose, they will be considered collaborators of the
"pro-American Zardari government" which, the Taliban claim, is not different
from the regime of former President Pervez Musharraf, it said. 

 The
Taliban from Swat and Bajaur tribal region, where the military is conducting
operations against militants, have included some religious and jehadi leaders,
"who are not ready to fight inside Pakistan against their own countrymen", in
their hit lists. 

 The Taliban have also accused some militant leaders from
the tribal areas and some leaders of the banned Lashker-e-Taiba, Harkatul
Mujahideen and Hizbul Mujahideen of trying to stop youngsters from fighting
Pakistani forces. They have declared these "pro-Pakistan" jehadis as their
enemies.
