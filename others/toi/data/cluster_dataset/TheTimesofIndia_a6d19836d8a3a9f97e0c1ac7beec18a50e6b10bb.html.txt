
After Aamir Khan's Fanaa faced the ire of protesters in Gujarat over his remarks
on the Narmada dam, it is now superstar Shah Rukh Khan's
turn.

 Supporters of Bharatiya
Janashakti Party, headed by its chief Uma Bharati, attacked a movie hall in
Indore screening Shah Rukh's Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna over his statement comparing
aerated drinks with mother's
milk.

 The morning show of the
film had to be stalled after protesters began shouting slogans inside Regal
theatre and tore down hoardings and posters. The screening resumed only after
policemen dispersed the agitators.


 The agitators were protesting
against Shah Rukh's statement that whether the agency that tested the soft drink
for pesticides had analysed if mother's milk also contained harmful chemicals.


 The actor was replying to the
queries of mediapersons whether celebrities should continue endorsing the soft
drinks in wake of the present pesticides controversy. 


 His remarks had angered
Bharati's followers who had earlier a protest on August 12. The party workers
had demanded an apology from Shah Rukh within 10 days, failing which they had
threatened to stall the screening of his latest film.


 Yadav said the police received
a call around 11 am that miscreants disrupting the screening. They were also
informed that men wielding saffron flags with a sun symbol (Uma's party symbol)
were tearing posters and defacing hoarding of the film.
