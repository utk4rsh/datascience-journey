 Hailing the regional grouping's decision to accept it as an observer,
China on Tuesday said it supports the SAARC process and was ready to intensify
cooperation with its countries in various fields including infrastructure and
energy. 

 "South Asia is not
just another region of the globe", Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing said
addressing the 14th SAARC Summit here.


 "Good political atmosphere,
close geographical location and popular support would greatly boost China-SAARC
Cooperation," he said adding that Beijing proposes to institutionalise the
China-South Asia Business Forum to serve as a platform for discussion on
economic cooperation and trade.


 He said Beijing will hold a
workshop for South Asian diplomats on contemporary China and invite senior
diplomats to visit the country this year.


 "As close neighbours, China
and SAARC countries enjoy deep traditional friendship and there is a strong
foundation for advancing our cooperation. We all belong to the developing world,
are experiencing fast growth and facing historic opportunities of development,"
he said.
