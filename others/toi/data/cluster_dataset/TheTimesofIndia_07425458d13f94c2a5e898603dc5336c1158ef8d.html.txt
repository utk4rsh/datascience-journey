 Pakistani investigators
have informed the government that they may have to stop their probe into the
Mumbai attacks due to lack of cooperation by authorities in India and several
other countries. 

 The Federal Investigation Agency, which is probing
the Mumbai terror attacks, has informed the interior ministry in a letter that
it would have custody of some suspects only for a few more days and it was thus
imperative to get cooperation from the other countries, Dawn News channel quoted
its sources as saying. 

 The FIA said it "may have to stop further
investigations" against the suspects due to the lack of cooperation by India and
other countries, the sources said. 

 There was no immediate word from
the interior ministry on the issue. 

 The investigators told the
interior ministry that they had not received the Indian police's chargesheet
against Ajmal Amir Kasab, the lone terrorist captured for the Mumbai attacks,
and other suspects. 

 There was also no response from the FBI and the
intelligence agencies of Spain, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia
for requests from Pakistan for information related to the terrorists involved in
the attacks.
