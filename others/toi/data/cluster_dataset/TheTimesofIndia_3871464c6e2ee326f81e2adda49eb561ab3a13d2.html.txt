 Silverstone circuit owners
reported unprecedented demand for British Grand Prix tickets on Tuesday, a day
after the race was confirmed on the 2010 Formula One calendar.


 Organisers said in a statement that they had sold just under 6,500
tickets, worth more than 1.2 million pounds ($1.96 million), for the July 11
race in the space of 24 hours. 

 Britain's future on the calendar had
been in doubt, despite the country being home to a majority of teams and
providing the last two champions in Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton, until a
17-year deal was agreed.
