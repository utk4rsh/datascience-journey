 Hours after PM Manmohan Singh put Pakistan on notice regarding the
proposed anti-terror mechanism by saying that it was Pakistan's last chance to
prove itself in the war against terror, Pakistan President Gen Pervez Musharraf
lobbed the ball back at him saying it was a test for India
too.

 "An institutional
arrangement is required for both sides... This institutional arrangement will
give comfort to both sides... We also have some observations about interference
in our country," Musharraf was quoted as saying in New York.


 Though he described the new
group as "essential" to stamp out terror in both countries, Musharraf seems
determined to ensure both countries remain tarred by the same terror brush,
adding fuel to the "trust deficit" that worried Manmohan
Singh.

 Both in his book and in
his public statements, Musharraf has been careful to keep Pakistan and India on
the same page. Pakistan is a sponsor of terror? So is India, he says. Pakistan's
A Q Khan is the world's most famous proliferator?


 India's enrichment programme
came from A Q Khan's Dubai network, he alleges. The volley of retorts bodes ill
for a new mechanism between India and Pakistan that, if successful, could become
the biggest confidence-building measure
ever.

 As Shiv Shankar Menon and
Riaz Mohammed Khan prepare for their first foreign secretary-level meeting in
November, the shape of the new anti-terror mechanism is the talk of the
establishment.

 While the shape
and mandate of this new group is not clear, indications are that it might be
"inspired" by the special representatives who are working on the India-China
boundary dispute. It is clear that for the new group to produce results, it will
need the kind of political mandate that the special representatives
enjoy.
