 Pakistan President Pervez
Musharraf had told veteran Gandhian Nirmala Deshpande some days before she died
that he favoured clemency for Indian death row prisoner Sarabjit Singh, her aide
claimed on Friday. 

 The telephonic conversation between Musharraf and
Deshpande, who died on Thursday, took place a fortnight ago when the Gandhian
called him to plead for Sarabjit's life. 

 "Didi (Deshpande) called
Musharraf a fortnight ago regarding Sarabjit's case. Musharraf told her that he
also did not want the Indian prisoner to be hanged," Shivnath Ram, Deshpande's
aide for the past 30 years, said. 

 Musharraf had on Thursday called
to offer condolences over Deshpande's death. "I picked up the phone on Thursday.
Musharraf told me that she was like a sister to him. He also said that he spoke
to Didi about Sarabjit when she called him a fortnight ago," Ram said.


 Sarabjit, accused of triggering blasts in Lahore, is currently
lodged in Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore. 

 Deshpande was to go to Nepal
this Sunday on an invitation from Maoist leader Prachanda, who is tipped to
become Prime Minister of the Himalayan country. 

 "Prachanda also
called us to express his grief. They call her 'Didi'. They wanted her to take
India-Nepal friendship forward," Ram said. 

 There were also telephone
calls from a large number of admirers, including one from the office of the
Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, he said.
