
 I
don't feel the need to be 'patriotic' on 15th August, because I am very
jingoistic by nature. I don't believe in saying Mera Bharat Mahan or wearing a
Tri-colour saree on 26th January or 15th August to show my patriotism.


 I laugh at people who wake up on this day and realise they
need to do something for their country. As a citizen of this country, I try and
follow the ideologies of people who have made a difference to our nation and
incorporate their principles in my daily life. 

 It's also important
that celebrities make a difference and that we pick up causes that are close to
our hearts. Instead of just being Page 3 celebrities, we can use our
'celebrityhood' to do something worthwhile. By lending our support to causes
like the Greenpeace movement or killing of dogs we can try and inspire people to
do the same in their lives. In fact, we will be having a special round of desh
bhakti (patriotic) songs on Indian Idol. 

 If given a chance, I'll
join active politics because, I believe, there is a need for young and
enthusiastic politicians. In fact, it's high time that the youth stopped
complaining and did something positive for the
country.
