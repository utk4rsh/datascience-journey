 Refusing to resign from the
post of Speaker as asked for by the CPM, Somnath Chatterjee had argued that the
position he was occupying was above party politics and that he would resign when
he thinks it is right.

 But for more than four years that Chatterjee
has been occupying the Speaker's post, he has not only been renewing his party
membership but has also been duly paying the levy of 5% of his monthly salary to
the party. As per the CPM constitution, party members earning Rs 8,000 or more a
month have to pay 5% as levy to the party. Chatterjee's levy was also received
in the month of July.

 Party sources also confirmed on Wednesday that
throughout his stint as Speaker, Chatterjee took the help of party cadre to
carry out development works in Bolpur, his Lok Sabha constituency.

 A
senior party leader said, "We only removed him from the party. He can continue
to occupy the Speaker's post if he wants. We are not even going to press for his
disqualification as MP. A section of the party in Bengal is not happy with the
decision but disciplinary action had to be taken. He is there because the party
decided to have him as Speaker. It is a correct decision and ultimately the
party cadre would appreciate it."

 While maintaining that Chatterjee
is free to approach the CPM's Control Commission against his expulsion, a senior
leader said, "I doubt he would do that. He must be feeling liberated
now."

 Party sources also denied that any formula has been devised by
party veteran Jyoti Basu. According to the formula, Chatterjee would resign from
the Speaker's post in August and then go to the Control Commission seeking
redressal of his expulsion. 

 "There is no such formula by Jyoti Basu
or anyone. It is Chatterjee's own formula that he wants to test," a senior
leader asserted.
