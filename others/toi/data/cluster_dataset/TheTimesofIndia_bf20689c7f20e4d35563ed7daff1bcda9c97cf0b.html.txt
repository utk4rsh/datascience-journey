
 Bollywood turned up in big numbers to
vote in the assembly polls. All three Khans-Shah Rukh, Salman, Aamir-were there.
While SRK spoke about cleanliness, infrastructure and the economy, and Salman
voted for "prosperity," Aamir wanted, "a leader who does not rule on the basis
of caste or creed."

 Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan voted in Juhu, minus
Abhi and Ash, who were shooting with Mani Ratnam. Samajwadi party leader Sanjay
Dutt came with wife Manyata. "Whoever wins should fulfil all promises," said
Munnabhai. Manyata, though, said she was only voting to exercise her fundamental
right but had no expectations because, "they are never
fulfilled."

 Khiladi Kumar Akshay was registered as a voter two
stations. "I voted at Lokhandwala since my ration card has that address. But I
have a house in Juhu too," clarified Kumar.

 As always, John Abraham
was one of the first actors to vote. John stressed on the importance of better
infrastructure in Mumbai. First-time voter Priyanka Chopra had to wait for over
an hour at a Versova polling booth after the EVM collapsed. "Since I'm young, I
want the new government to be youth focused," said Chopra.

 Director
Karan Johar had to make two trips to the polling booth after he was sent back
for not carrying a voting slip. "Infrastructure, slum rehab and citizen
protection against civil and criminal injustice should be the core issues," said
Johar.

 Zayed Khan, Ranjeet , Prem Chopra, Anupam and Kiron Kher, Javed
Akhtar and Shabana Azmi, Gulzar, Rishi Kapoor and Naseer also
