 The Indian and Sri Lankan
teams arrived in Nagpur on Wednesday for the second ODI on December 18 at
Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium at Jamtha. 

 The teams arrived in
the city from Rajkot, where the first of the five-match series was played, by a
chartered flight. India are leading 1-0. 

 The second ODI was
scheduled to be played at Visakhapatnam, but the match was shifted to the orange
city due to the ongoing agitation in Andhra Pradesh over the Telangana statehood
issue. 

 Nagpur had hosted a Twenty20 International between the two
teams earlier this month. 

 Meanwhile, preparations for the match were
nearing completion at the venue, located on the city's outskirts. Long queues
were witnessed for tickets.
