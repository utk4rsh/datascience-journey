
 WINDERMERE (Florida): A police officer
who responded to Tiger Woods' car accident found $235 in the vehicle and two
iron golf clubs on the ground next to a golf cart. 

 The Windermere
officer said in a report released on Monday that Woods was at first
unresponsive. The officer, whose name wasn't released, said the world's No. 1
golfer then tried to stand up before the officer told him to lie down. Woods was
bleeding from cut lips but was breathing normally. His wife, Elin, was kneeling
over him. 

 The report released in response to state public records
requests showed the cash was in the center console of Woods' Cadillac Escalade.


 The Florida Highway Patrol last week closed its inquiry into the
November 27 crash. Woods was charged with careless driving. Several women have
since claimed affairs with him.
