 Lance Armstrong will retire for
good after the 2011 season and will do everything in his power to win an eighth
Tour de France title in the next two years, the American said on
Thursday.

 The 38-year-old American, who returned to cycling in
January after three and a half years in retirement, has set up his new
Radioshack team and taken most of his former Astana team mates with him, except
great rival and Tour champion Alberto Contador.

 "After 2011, I'll
retire," Armstrong told a newspaper from a training camp in
Arizona.

 "This team hasn't been constructed for me, I'm 38. Our aims
go further than Armstrong."

 Contador, who opted to stick to his
contract with a weakened Astana despite having other offers, is training in
Italy this week and Armstrong said the Spaniard would be difficult to beat in
France next July whoever he races with.

 "Alberto is an incredible
talent, better than anyone both on the bike and mentally. I'm not an idiot, it
will be hard to beat him. Some say impossible. We'll see," said Armstrong, who
blamed a "clash of personalities" for 2009's tension with
Contador.

 Armstrong, who welcomed news the Giro d'Italia could start
from Washington in 2012, also said he would end his independent doping controls
and stop putting results online because they cause silly speculation and
authorities test constantly anyway.
