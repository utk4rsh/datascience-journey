 Nike Inc chairman and
co-founder Phil Knight said the scandal surrounding Tiger Woods is "part of the
game" in signing endorsement deals with athletes and did not back away from the
athletic shoe and clothing maker's relationship with the golfer.

 Woods, 33,
has admitted to "infidelity" in his marriage to his Swedish wife Elin Nordegren
as allegations of multiple extra-marital affairs have rocked his life and
career.

 Knight told Street & Smith's SportsBusiness Journal that
Nike checked out Woods' background before signing its deal with the golfer and
"he came out clean."

 Knight's comments were published following
Woods' surprise announcement on Friday that he would take an "indefinite break"
from pro golf.

 Knight said companies cannot get such background
checks right all the time and "there's always a risk." However, he signaled no
move to distance Woods from Nike, which has founded its global golf business on
Woods' reputation and play.

 "I think he's been really great," Knight
said in the interview published on Monday. "When his career is over, you'll look
back on these indiscretions as a minor blip, but the media is making a big deal
out of it right now."

 Other sponsors have distanced themselves from
Woods.

 On Sunday, technology outsourcing and consulting firm
Accenture Plc ended its endorsement deal with Woods, a day after Procter &
Gamble's Gillette said it would limit the use of Woods in its marketing.
AT&T Inc has said it is evaluating its relationship.

 Woods, the
world's first billionaire athlete, is estimated to earn about $100 million a
year in endorsement deals.

 Other sponsors include PepsiCo Inc's
Gatorade, Electronic Arts Inc, TLC Vision Corp, Upper Deck, Berkshire Hathaway
Inc's NetJets and Tag Heuer.
