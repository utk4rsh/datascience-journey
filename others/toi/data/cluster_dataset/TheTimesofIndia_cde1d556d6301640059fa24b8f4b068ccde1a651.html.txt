 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish
Kumar today urged the Centre to extend financial assistance for rehabilitation
of those affected by the recent floods in the state on the lines of the ones
provided to the tsunami victims.

 "We have submitted a detailed
report to the Centre seeking financial package for rehabilitating the victims of
Kosi floods on the lines of tsunami victims and our officials are holding
discussions with the officials concerned in New Delhi in this connection," Kumar
said.

 The Chief Minister, while intervening during the state
Disaster Management Minister Nitish Mishra's reply to a short notice question of
Kishore Kumar (Ind) on the recent floods in the state, said the Centre had
provided a sum of Rs one lakh to each of the households as part of the
rehabilitation package after tsunami hit the country.

 Even as the
opposition parties continued to boycott the proceedings of the House for the
third consecutive day demanding extension of the "extremely brief" session,
Kumar urged the opposition leaders to mount pressure on the Centre for
sanctioning the rehabilitation package for flood hit people shortly.
