 In a veiled attack on BJP,
Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh today said people who were pressing
for demand to book the accused involved in terrorist activities under Prevention
of Terrorism Act (POTA) till yesterday, have surprisingly retracted from their
statements.

 Deshmukh, who was in Latur to inaugurate crushing season
of Manjra and Rena co-operative sugar factories.

 To a question he
said, "We tried a lot to make all parties participate in the discussion to stop
defamation of Maharashtra across the country. The leaders of northern states
came together, but here in our state BJP had some problems but Left parties
participated."

 Replying to a question about the involvement of
right-wing Hindu organisations in Malegaon blast, Deshmukh said that terrorism
should not be related to religion and government is taking action against such
people on the basis of evidence and their involvement.

 Replying to a
question regarding Raj Thackeray and the state earning a bad name due to MNS'
campaign against non Marathis, he said,"Obviously it is due to Raj Thackeray
that Mahrashtra has been defamed in the country and it is being made an
issue."

 When asked whether he was feeling relieved after Margaret
Alva, critical of functioning of Deshmukh's government, was stripped off key
posts in Congress, he said, "I am a medium pace bowler."
