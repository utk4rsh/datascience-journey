 Japan has contributed an additional USD 7 million to the 'SAARC-Japan
Special Fund' for furthering social and cultural exchanges with South Asia while
pledging support for improving regional
connectivity.

 Addressing the
14th SAARC Summit here as an observer, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso said
that the government of Japan shall cooperate more with SAARC to achieve better
regional connectivity and is keen on supporting priority
projects.

 The seven million
dollar fund is especially for financing youth activities. Japan will receive
over 500 high school and university students from the SAARC countries every
year.

 Japan is also expecting
to increase its investment in India to USD 5.5 billion from USD 515 million in
2006, according to a spokesman of the Japanese Foreign
Ministry.

 The investment will
be mainly in the automobile
sector.

 "We hope to finalise
the Free Trade Agreement with India within this year and this is key to
investment," the spokesman
said.

 The country will also
work together with the Asian Development Bank to improve transportation in the
region and improve disaster
management.

 Besides, it stated
its support to the democratisation process in Nepal and
Bhutan.

 In his address, Aso
said that as part of the SAARC as observer nation, Japan was advancing a new
initiative to create an arc of freedom and
prosperity.

 "The outer rim of
the Eurasian Continent has seen historic transitions in many countries. A new
frontier, or an arc, has emerged. It is a growth region, more stable than ever,
committed to universal values. South Asia indeed makes a central pillar of the
Arc," he said.

 He said when
Japan's post-war economic miracle was yet to take shape, South Asia helped its
people and India and Pakistan provided Japan with crucial materials like iron
ore and raw cotton.
