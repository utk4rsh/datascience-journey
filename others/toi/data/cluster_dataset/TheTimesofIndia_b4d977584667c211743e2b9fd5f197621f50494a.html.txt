
Releasing its manifesto for the Lok Sabha polls, the LJP said it was in favour
of creation of smaller states like Telangana as it was necessary for better
administration and development.


 "The party believes that for
better administration and development of neglected regions, formation of smaller
states is necessary," party chief Ramvilas Paswan said, while releasing the
party manifesto here. 

 The
manifesto also promised to take the initiative for socio-economic and
educational development of the minorities, especially Muslims in the light of
the findings of the Sachar Committee.


 He said organisations like the
RSS, VHP and Bajrang Dal would be banned if the LJP is voted to power and the
party would bring a 'communal riot control act' against communal activities.


 Paswan promised to make public
and implement the recommendations of the Ranganath Mishra Commission, saying
there would be a provision of 15 per cent reservation for minorities of which 10
per cent would be for Muslims.


 The LJP also promised to
provide reservations to women and OBCs in government jobs and the judiciary for
which 50 per cent ceiling imposed by the Supreme Court would be removed through
appropriate legislation.
