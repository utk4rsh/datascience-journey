 The Delhi HC on Tuesday
refused to entertain till February 16 an application moved by five expelled MPs
in the cash for query scam. 

 The MPs had moved an application seeking
a direction to the Union government to provide them the privileges they were
entitled to as members of Parliament till the time the apex court was seized of
the matter.

 A Division Bench of Justices Vijender Jain and Rekha
Sharma, while refusing to entertain the plea at this stage, however, gave an
assurance that it would examine the plea after February 16 if the Supreme Court
does not decide to hear all the petitions related to MPs, including those filed
in the high court.
