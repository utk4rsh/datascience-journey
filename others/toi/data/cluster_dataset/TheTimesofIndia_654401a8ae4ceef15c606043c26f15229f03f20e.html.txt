 Setting the process of
releasing Indian prisoners in motion, Pakistan has said it would free 20 of
them, including six Sikhs, on Saturday at the Wagah border point in Punjab.


 "In pursuance of the decision taken by Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah
Khan Jamali's on May 6, Pakistan has decided to release 14 crew members of the
Indian cargo boat 'Raj Laxhmi' as well as six Sikh youth whose national status
has been confirmed by the Indian government," an official statement said here
late last night.

 It said that 16 other Sikhs will be released shortly
after their national status is verified by Indian government. 

 The 20
prisoners would be handed over to Indian authorities at Wagah on Saturday, May
17, the statement said, adding the decision has already been conveyed to the
Indian government. 

 Jamali, while announcing measures to normalise
relations with India, said Pakistan would release 22 sikh youths, 14 crew
members of Raj Lakshmi along with Indian fishermen. Over 300 Indian fishermen
are currently held by Pakistan. 

 Indian High Commission officials
here said the 20 prisoners to be released on May 17 were identified by Indian
government through the counsellor access provided by Pakistan.

 The
rest of over 300 Indian prisoners, including 16 Sikhs, would be released after
verification process by India. The Sikhs were reportedly arrested after they
crossed over to Pakistan from Iran. 

 The officials said Pakistan
government permitted counsellor access to the Indian prisoners just around the
same time when Jamali announced the decision on May 6.
