 Three of the six expelled BJP MPs caught accepting money in the "Cash for
Questions" scam on Wednesday filed an application in the Delhi High Court
seeking quashing of the expulsions and restoration of their
memberships.

 The petitioners
also urged the court to restrain the Election Commission from issuing any
notification to fill up the vacancies caused by their
expulsions.

 In separate
applications filed through their counsels, the three expelled MPs Chandra Pratap
Singh, Suresh Chandelal and Yashwanth G Mahajan maintained that their expulsions
were "illegal" and
"unconstitutional."

 They
contended that Parliament had no power to effect such expulsions and as such the
action taken by the Speaker Somnath Chatterjee was in "excess of the
jurisdiction" vested upon the
former.

 The petitioners, while
pleading their innocence, in the alleged scandal complained that the Pawal
Bansal Committee which probed the issue adopted a partisan approach by failing
to give them even minimum opportunity to defend themselves and hence violated
the "principles of natural
justice."

 On Tuesday, two other
expelled MPs -- Narender Kumar Kushwar (BSP) and Manoj Kumar (RJD)-- had also
moved the High Court challenging Parliament's right to strip them of their
membership.
