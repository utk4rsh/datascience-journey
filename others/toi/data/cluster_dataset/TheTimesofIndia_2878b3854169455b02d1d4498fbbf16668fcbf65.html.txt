 Michael Phelps won the
200-yard butterfly Sunday, giving the 14-time Olympic champion five first-place
finishes in five events at the three-day North Baltimore Aquatic Center's
Christmas meet at the U.S. Naval Academy.

 Phelps, swimming for the
host NBAC, finished in 1 minute, 42.29 seconds, nearly 3 seconds ahead of Todd
Patrick.

 During the meet's first two days, Phelps won the 100
backstroke, 100 butterfly, 200 freestyle and 400 individual medley. He had also
been scheduled to swim in the 100 freestyle on Sunday and swam it in
preliminaries, but skipped the final to concentrate on the 200 fly. The two
events were 22 minutes apart.

 Phelps said he will compete next with
the U.S. team in this weekend's Duel in the Pool short-course meet in
Manchester, England, against an international team of swimmers from England,
Germany and Italy. After that, he plans to train for three weeks at the Olympic
training center in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

 More than 600 swimmers
from age 10 and up competed in the GBAC meet, in its 36th year. Phelps had
competed here many times as a youth and teenager, but last swam in the NBAC
event in 2004.
