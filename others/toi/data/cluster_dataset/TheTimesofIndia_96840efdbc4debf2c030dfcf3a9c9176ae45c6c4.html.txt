 The Supreme Court on
Wednesday upheld the expulsion of 11 MPs from Parliament for their involvement
in the cash-for-query scam. The apex court on Wednesday also said that
Parliament has the power to expel erring MPs and said that the procedure adopted
by both Houses in expelling the members cannot be said to be
illegal.

 In December 2005, these MPs from across political parties
had been caught on television cameras accepting money to ask questions in
Parliament. When expelled from the two Houses in Parliament, they moved court in
January 2006, challenging the expulsion.

 The sting operation had led
to a debate on the ethics of such operations and the cash-for-query scandal had
also become a major flashpoint in the relationship between the legislature and
the judiciary last year. 

 The judgements on the 11 petitions were
delivered by a Bench comprising Chief Justice Y K Sabharwal and Justices K G
Balakrishnan, C K Thakker, R V Raveendran and D K Jain. Three judges —
Justices Sabharwal, Thakker and Raveendran — pronounced their judgments on
the petitions.
