 The FBI investigations into
the November terror attack have established a Pakistan link to the payments made
for the VoIP card from Callphonex of the US.

 VoIP allows one to make
cheap phone calls over Internet and payment for it can be made by wire transfer
from anywhere in the world. ‘‘We have traced the financial
transactions to Pakistan,’’ a senior official said. 

 At
the same time, the official said that they have not been able to gather evidence
admissible in court to pinpoint that the calls originated from
Pakistan.

 ‘‘We are in the process of gathering further
evidence and solve the jigsaw puzzle in the next few days. However, we have been
able to obtain enough material linking Pakistan to the terror attack, but at
this stage some of it is not admissible as evidence in the court,’’
the officer said.

 One of the virtual numbers from which the call to
the terrorists was made was set up with a US company Callphonex by one Kharak
Singh who claimed to be from India. The money for the same came through Western
Union money transfer from one Javed Iqbal in Pakistan.
