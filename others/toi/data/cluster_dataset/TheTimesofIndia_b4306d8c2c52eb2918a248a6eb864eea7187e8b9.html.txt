 "As
far as the other non-Congress entities are concerned these are mere allegations
which are required to be proved before the Parliamentary committee going into
the issue," party Spokespersons Abhishek Singhvi told reporters.


 He said if the BJP has failed
in Parliament it should await the committee's proceedings and findings and
should not "try to create drama in the media everyday".


 Singhvi said the BJP's latest
allegation was nothing but "old wine in old bottle. They are simply repeating
same old allegations which they have made since the trust vote."


 The BJP on Sunday submitted
some "facts" to the parliamentary inquiry committee in the 'cash for votes'
scam, claiming that it will "conclusively establish the veracity of their
complaints".
