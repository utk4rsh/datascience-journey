 Leaders from SAARC countries on Tuesday sought "bold" steps to combat
terrorism to fullfil the vision of peace, prosperity and cooperation in South
Asia with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh asking member nations to implement
sincerely the pledge to root out the scourge.


 Addressing the 14th SAARC
Summit in New Delhi, the leaders from the eight countries emphasised that the
dream of a prosperous South Asia was not possible without addressing the
security concerns of regional countries.


 In his inaugural address,
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made it clear that there was need for the
countries in the region to go beyond commitments to fight
terrorism.

 "A primary
requirement for the fullfilment of our vision of prosperity and cooperation in
South Asia is peace. We should, therefore, implement in a meaningful and sincere
manner the commitments and pledges to root out terrorism so as to create the
atmosphere in which our endeavours can succeed," he
stressed.

 Sharing the concern,
Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse warned that unless the countries in the
region acted collectively, "trans-border groups will find safe havens in other
parts of the region".

 "Modern
day terrorists operate in a multi-dimensional fashion. They operate politically,
militarily, financially and ideologically," he said.


 Chief Adviser of Bangladesh
Government Fakhruddin Ahmed made a strong pitch for addressing the "root causes"
that lead to violent actions.


 "We must make bold efforts to
combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations," he said emphasizing that
it would be impossible to realise the dream of a prosperous South Asia without
addressing the security concerns of regional countries.
