
 MALELANE (South Africa): Delhi pro
Shiv Kapur put himself back on the track for a top 10 finish, leapfrogging to
tied 12th with a stellar penultimate round of four-under 68 in the Alfred
Dunhill Golf Championship. 

 The Indian golfer brought home his second
card of 68 this week for a 54-hole total of nine-under 207 to join four others
at the 12th spot and lie five shots off the lead. 

 Spaniard Pablo
Martin (202) carded 71 to stay two shots ahead of Ernie Els and Charl Schwartzel
who carded 69 and 68 respectively. 

 Barring the fourth hole bogey,
Shiv Kapur's round had hardly any flaw. 

 The Delhi pro parred the
opening hole and followed it up with back-to-back birdies before dropping his
lone bogey on the par-four fourth hole. 

 Shiv birdied the sixth to
make amends and lie three-under at the turn. 

 On his way back, the
Indian birdied the 14th and 18th while keeping it bogey-free all along to
improve on his overnight tied 23rd position.
