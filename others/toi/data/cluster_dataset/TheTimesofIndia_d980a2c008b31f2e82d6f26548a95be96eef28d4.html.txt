
The Kerala High Court on Friday quashed the state government's order banning
production and sale of Coca-Cola and Pepsi in the
state.

 A division bench
comprising Chief Justice VK Bali and Justice M Ramachandran, passed the order on
petitions filed by Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Ltd and Pepsi India Holding
Private Ltd challenging the ban of beverages in the
state.

 The bench upheld the
contention of the two soft drink companies that the state government had no
jurisdiction to impose a ban on manufacture and sale of their products. In a
petition, the cola giants said that the ban was unconstitutional and their
products were safe to
consume.

 Last month, the Kerala
government had banned the products after Delhi-based NGO Centre for Science and
Environment allegedly found pesticide residues in various soft drinks of the two
companies.
