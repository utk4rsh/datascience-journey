 A Belgian court has
suspended the one-year bans handed to Belgian tennis players Yanina Wickmayer
and Xavier Malisse for missing drug tests. 

 Wickmayer's lawyers hope
that Monday's injunction will make 16-ranked Wickmayer eligible to play as soon
as possible. The semi-finalist at the US Open hopes to receive a wildcard for
the Australian Open. 

 Wickmayer and Malisse were suspended by a
Belgian court on November 5 for missing three drug tests in violation of World
Anti-Doping Agency rules. The International Tennis Federation imposed the bans
worldwide. 

 Wickayer's lawyer, Kristof De Saedeleer, said it should
be "logical" to scrap the ban if the original ruling was suspect. 

 It
was unclear when a full ruling would be announced.
