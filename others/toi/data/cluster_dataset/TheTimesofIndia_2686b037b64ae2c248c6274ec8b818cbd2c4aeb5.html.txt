 Franz Beckenbauer does
not like Brazil's style of play under coach Dunga, the German great said on
Tuesday. 

 Five-times champions Brazil are one of the favourites to
win the 2010 World Cup in South Africa after adopting a ruthlessly, efficient
approach in qualifying that was not particularly attractive to watch.


 Beckenbauer, the only man to win the World Cup as a coach (1990) and
player (1974), is clearly not a fan. 

 "If you talk about Brazil, then
in my mind it is the team (that won the World Cup) from 1970," he told delegates
at the Soccerex business convention. 

 "Carlos Alberto, Pele, you know
(always played) offense, offense. In this team they have just one striker Kaka
and a little bit behind you have Robinho. 

 "He can play in a circus
but he's not a team player. I don't know this Brazil. I don't like the style the
team play," added Beckenbauer. 

 Dunga, Brazil's World Cup-winning
captain in 1994, was appointed after the 2006 finals despite having almost no
top-level coaching experience. 

 One of his tasks was to instill
discipline and pride in the players but many purists dislike the team's
counter-attacking style under him. 

 "The coach is angry with me
because I say this publicly but sorry, for me, Brazil is (about) offense,
scoring goals, not controlled soccer," said Beckenbauer. 

 "For me
Spain is the best team in Europe and maybe the best team in the world right
now."
