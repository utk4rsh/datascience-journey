 Liverpool manager Rafael
Benitez has revealed the Premier League club is in talks with Argentina
midfielder Javier Mascherano about extending his contract at Anfield.


 Mascherano has been linked with a move to European champions
Barcelona in recent months after admitting he has found it hard to settle on
Merseyside. 

 But Benitez is desperate to keep the 25-year-old, who
has two years left on his current deal, and is already discussing an improved
contract. 

 "We were talking with him and his agent a month ago about
our idea and his idea," Benitez said. 

 "Everyone can see he's doing
really well and has come back to his best. We were really pleased to talk to him
to make progress. 

 "We have plenty of time but we are happy with him
and he is happier now too. He has two more years on his contract, we were
talking before and we will sit down sooner rather than later and talk about the
future. The last conversations that we had were very positive."
