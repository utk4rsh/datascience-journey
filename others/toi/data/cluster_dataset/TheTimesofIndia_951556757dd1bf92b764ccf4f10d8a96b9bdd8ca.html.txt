 With Islamabad raising
questions about the alleged links between the Samjhauta Express blast and the
Mumbai terror attacks, India on Monday said Pakistan was trying to rake up "old"
issues but promised to share whatever is possible. 

 "What they have
done, they have raised some questions.... The responses will be, in wherever it
is possible, in whatever way we can send, responses to those questions they have
raised, will be sent," external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee told
reporters. 

 He was responding to a question on Pakistan foreign
minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi's attempt to link the Mumbai attacks with the
Samjhauta blasts. Four days ago, Pakistan admitted that the Mumbai attacks were
planned and executed by its nationals and raised a set of 30 questions to
further the probe. 

 "Therefore, if somebody tries to bring certain
issues which are old, it may have some relevance, they may have some information
and whichever information they have shared with us, we will examine that and
take corrective action," Mukherjee said. 

 India has welcomed
Pakistan's admission about the role of its nationals in the Mumbai terror attack
but reminded the latter to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism in its
territory.
