 A Jamshedpur court today
directed the Police Commissioner of Mumbai to execute the non-bailable arrest
warrant issued by it against Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj
Thackeray.

 The order came from first class judicial magistrate A K
Tiwary when Thackeray failed to appear before the court today in connection with
a petition by lawyer Hameed Raza Khan under sectioins 153 (rioting), 295 (a
non-bailable section for hurting religious sentiments) and other relevant
sections of IPC for the MNS leader's remarks against Chat festival early this
year.

 The court also directed the authorities concerned to produce
Thackeray before the court on January 7.

 Earlier, the court had
rejected Thackeray's petition seeking exemption from personal appearance and
issued a fresh non-balible warrant against Thackeray on December one after he
failed to appear in the court on that day.

 Thackeray had procured am
interim bail of 15 days from Mazgaon court in Mumbai against the non-bailable
warrant issued by the same court on September 30 and he was asked to appear on
December one.

 Another court, that of first class judicial magistrate
(II) Anil Kumar, too issued a non-bailble warrant against Thackray two days
ago.

 Thackeray faces three non-bailable arrest warrants from
Jamshedpur courts.
