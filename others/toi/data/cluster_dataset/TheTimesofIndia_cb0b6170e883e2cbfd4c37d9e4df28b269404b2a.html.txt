 Pakistan on Wednesday
expressed disappointment over the Commonwealth's decision to keep it suspended,
even as its foreign minister welcomed the 54-nation grouping's observations on
the restoration of democratic institutions and campaign against corruption in
the country.

 The Commonwealth foreign ministers meeting in London on
Tuesday decided to keep Pakistan's membership suspended till December in view of
the deadlock between the political parties and President Pervez Musharraf over
the legality of constitutional amendments was amicably sorted.


 Stating that the Commonwealth has "missed the fundamental point",
the foreign ministry in a statement said, "The essence of the matter is that
Pakistan is governed by elected, civilian governments at the Centre and in the
four provinces of the federation which are answerable to their Parliaments and
to the people of Pakistan."

 However, Pakistan Foreign Minister
Khursid Muhmad Kasuri welcomed the "positive" statement made by the group's
foreign ministers about restoration of democratic institutions and campaign
against corruption in the country.
