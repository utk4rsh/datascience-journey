 American mediation on the
Kashmir issue would not be in Islamabad's interest and in line with the wishes
of the Kashmiris, a Paksitani law maker has said.

 "America views
Kashmiri fighters as terrorists and in such situation a fair solution is
impossible through US mediation," Hussain, who is also a former information
minister, said at a seminar organised by the ruling PML (Q) on Indo-Pak
ties.

 He said any American mediation on Kashmir would not be in line
with the wishes of Kashmiris as well as in accordance with Pakistan's policy.


 Instead, the PML (Q) senator favoured mediation by the European
Union.

 He also the slammed the US decision to put Pakistan-based
militant organisation Hizbul Mujahideen on its terror list.

 "The US
has taken the decision against the Hizb without any basis and Pakistan should
not accept it," he said.

 The US last month put Hizbul Mujahideen on
its terror list.
