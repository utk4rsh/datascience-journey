 Maharashtra government's
two-month ban on 'Deshdrohi', the film reportedly based on north Indian migrants
to Mumbai, comes after city police took into consideration the backlash from MNS
and others if the film was allowed to be released in the present
format.

 "There has been criticism from various quarters, specially
the north Indian leaders over the state's law and order situation in the
backdrop of Raj Thackeray-led MNS' violent agitation against north Indians.
Police did not want to take any chance," a senior Home Department official
said.

 The movie is scheduled to be released on November 14. Promos of
the film airing on several TV channels had given police a taste of things to
come as several dialogues were construed as being
provocative.

 "Police submitted a report to the government after
watching the film and recommended a ban on it, apprehending law and order
problems," the official said.

 Joint Commissioner of Police (Law &
Order) K L Prasad, Additional Director Generals D Shivanandan and Ahmed Javed
were among the top police officers who watched the film on November eight. They
had asked the film's writer, producer and actor Kamaal Khan for a separate
screening before its release in view of the MNS' anti-north Indian campaign in
the state and backlash in various parts of the country.

 Khan reacted
sharply to the development, saying he would take legal recourse to ensure that
the film is released.

 MNS has welcomed the ban. Party spokesperson
Shirish Parkar told PTI that the government should not show guts and take action
against SP legislator Kishor Amrite who offered Rs one crore to anyone killing
Raj Thackeray.

 "The state government should not just boast to Delhi
leaders that they have filed as many as 54 cases against the MNS chief," Parkar
said.
