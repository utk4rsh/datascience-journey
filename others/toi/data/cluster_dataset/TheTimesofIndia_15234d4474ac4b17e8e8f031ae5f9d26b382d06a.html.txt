 Reigning champions Barcelona
clinched a place in the Champions League knockout stage with a 2-1 win over
hosts Dynamo Kiev on Wednesday, Lionel Messi netting an 86th-minute goal to
secure top spot in their group. 

 Forward Artem Milevsky fired Kiev
into an early lead, but Barcelona midfielder Xavi Hernandez levelled 12 minutes
before the break. 

 Dynamo, who desperately needed to win to continue
their campaign, got off to a flying start through Milevsky, who beat Victor
Valdes with a close-range header from Andrei Shevchenko's well-struck free-kick
in the second minute. 

 The Spanish champions, who were seeking to
hold off the challenge for first place from fellow qualifiers Inter Milan,
replied positively, pinning the hosts back in attempt to level but to no
immediate avail as Dynamo defended in numbers while relying on rare
counter-attacks. 

 In the 13th minute, newly-crowned Ballon D'Or
winner Messi missed a clear chance to level, when he received the ball after
Dynamo 'keeper Olexander Shovkovsky's mix-up and rushed into the hosts box.


 However, Shovkovsky managed to correct his error, parrying the
Argentinian forward's shot. 

 Barca kept on probing, keeping
Shovkovsky busy, and they pulled level in the 33rd minute, when Xavi redirected
Eric Abidal's left-handed cross into the net from close range. 

 After
interval the guests still looked more dominant, although in the 54th minute
Dynamo had another chance for a goal, Milevsky failing to score his second of
the match in sending a close-range header just wide from Shevchenko's freekick
out on the left. 

 Barcelona then seized their moment as Messi fired
home a precise free-kick with four minutes to go, dashing Kiev's hopes of
further progress.
