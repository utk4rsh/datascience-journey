
 Praise is something he's been used to
since he was a young kid but winning the Ballon d'Or was a cherished dream for
Lionel Messi. 

 The Barcelona striker, who moved to Spain because the
club offered to pay for the treatment of his growth hormone deficiency, has seen
his legend grow ever since he made his debut in 2004 - when he became the
youngest player to play a league game in the La Liga. 

 Beating out
the likes of shiny Cristiano Ronaldo and becoming the first Argentine to win the
Ballon has its own shine. 

 Meanwhile, the big Tiger is reduced to
purring apologies. Reticent when it comes to his personal life, Tiger Woods'
recent crash amidst spicy rumours of wife Elin Nordegren finding out about his
alleged affair with New York nightclub hostess, Rachel Ultichel, has set tongues
wagging. The appearance of a 'former mistress' Jaimee Grubbs, who has in her
possession pictures and texts sent to her by the golfer, has just made the whole
tale saucier. No wonder his team of advisors in desparately putting together a
damage control plan. 

 Italian
delight 

 Super coach Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan takes on Juventus
in what is the Italian League's big weekend clash on Sunday. Inter Milan may
have been kicked out of the Champions League but it still has its own league,
and associated home honours, to play for. Can Mourinho will his team to win the
title again this season? 

 Spanish
charge 

 After having missed last year's Davis Cup final, Rafael
Nadal will not want to miss the action this year. Even though he's not fully
fit, the clay master's presence automatically makes an already-strong Spanish
squad stronger. The Czech Republic, led by Radel Stepanek has a tough time on
its hands but to underestimate the Czech team would mean hara kari for
Spain.
