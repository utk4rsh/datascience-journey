 Indian pacer S Sreesanth was
admitted in a city hospital on Thursday night and the in-form speedster remains
under the doctors' observation following multiple ailments.

 Director
of Fortis, Mohali, Dr A R Banerjee said that the Kerala cricketer, who has been
ruled out of second Twenty20 International against Sri Lanka, is doing better
now. 

 "Sreesanth was brought here last night with cough, sore throat
and fever. Various tests have been done and he is doing fine," Banerjee said.


 He said samples have been taken for swine flu tests as well and the
results are awaited. 

 With the mercury going down, Chandigarh in the
past 10 days has seen a sharp increase in number of swine flu cases and has
already registered 10 deaths. 

 India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
earlier said Sreesanth would miss Saturday's match because of "viral infection".


 "Sreesanth has not recovered from viral infection," Dhoni
said.
