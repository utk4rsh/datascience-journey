 Pakistan are firmly in
control at the end of Day 2 after taking their score through to 264 and then
rolling New Zealand for 99.

 Scorecard

 The
Kiwis were hoping to wrap up the Pakistan innings before lunch for less than
200, but that wasnt to be the case as their tail wagged.

 Wicketkeeper
batsman Kamran Akmal was outstanding, hitting 70 runs and nursing the lower
order through to the respectable total.

 A 64-run stand between Akmal
and Umar Gul was the highest of the match and it took a piece of brilliance from
Daniel Vettori to break the partnership. Akmal was looking to clear mid-off, but
didnt quite get enough distance with Vettori taking an outstanding
over-the-shoulder catch.

 Daryl Tuffey took two wickets in the session
to finish with four for 64 with Vettori returning the teams best figures of four
for 58. The Kiwi openers were required to survive an awkward ten minutes before
lunch, but Mohammad Aamer made sure they were one down when he had Martin
Guptill caught behind after fishing outside off stump.

 Tim McIntosh
went shortly after lunch for four when he edged a ball into his pads and was
caught at short let. Ross Taylor comfortably hit 30 before misjudging a Umar Gul
length ball that came back and grazed his off stump. Peter Fulton came and went
after only two balls to have the Kiwis in all sorts of trouble at 52 for
four.
