 Former world champion Ruslan
Ponomariov of Ukraine overcame a point's deficit to put it across Russian
Vladimir Malakhov in the rapid tie-break games and enter the World Chess Cup
final.

 Ponomariov will meet top seed Boris Gelfand of Israel in the
final. Gelfand qualified after disposing off Ponomariov's compatriot Sergey
Karjakin 2-0 in games under normal time control. 

 Ponomariov had
drawn both the rapid games and Malakhov was the early winner in the first
tie-break game taking control of the match with black pieces. 

 But
Ponomariov, who holds the distinction of being the youngest ever world champion,
fired back with vengeance in the second game with black and equalised before
winning the remaining two games to clinch the match 4-2. 

 At 41,
Gelfand is around 15 years older than Ponomariov who has now established himself
as a fine exponent of the knock-out format. It may be recalled that Ponomariov
had won the world championship in 2001-02 ahead of Viswanathan Anand when the
championship was played in knockout format only. 

 The Ukrainian has
not had any spectacular successes otherwise in top events. 

 Gelfand
is a seasoned campaigner whose moment of big-glory is knocking now. Before the
World Cup, only a few were backing Gelfand for a final spot despite his top
seeding on ratings. 

 The final will begin on a four game basis which
is longer than the current two games that the players had to play till now. In
the event of a tied result, there will be games under normal time control to
determine the winner.
