 Former Australian opener
Justin Langer, who now plays first class cricket for Sussex, has described
Twenty20 cricket as a huge emotional, but brilliant exercise. 

 "It's
a massive emotional rollercoaster, Twenty20 cricket, and that was highlighted
again here. It's been amazing. Honestly, it's a great thing. Look at the people
jumping around ... it's brilliant. I'm rooted, I've got to say," the Sydney
Morning Herald quoted Langer as saying on the sidelines of a Deccan Chargers Vs
Trinidad and Tobago Champions League T20 clash. 

 For three hours,
Langer hardly moved, admitting afterwards he had not "watched that much cricket
for ages". 

 He had good reason to be on edge, a Chargers win would
have sent him into retirement, effective immediately. 

 While the
Sabres' last-ball victory over Deccan last weekend was dramatic, Langer said
watching Wednesday night's match, the last of round one in the Champions League
Twenty20, was harder to cope with. 

 The Champions League is a fitting
end to Langer's four-year stint at the English county side, which he's captained
for three years. 

 "I've had a great time at Somerset. We've gone from
bottom of everything in the second division three years ago, now we're playing
on the big stage. So, it does make you proud, definitely," he said.


 The left-hander was never favoured by Australia in the shorter form
of the game - he played only eight One-Day Internationals, yet in Twenty20 he
has proved to be a very effective opener, averaging 29.35 at a strike-rate of
138.8. 

 Langer said he had become a huge fan of Twenty20 since his
international retirement. 

 The financial implications of this
tournament are, Langer admitted, enormous for "all of us".
