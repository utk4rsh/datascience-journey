 Tigers Woods' long-time
caddie Steve Williams said he was standing by the world number one and would be
there when he was ready to play again.

 "I am committed to him. I
understand he needs a break to sort his personal stuff out. And I will be there
for him when he wishes to return to play," he told New Zealand's Sunday
News.

 Woods said on Friday he would take an indefinite break from the
game having admitted to infidelity in his marriage.

 "Tiger just said
he needs a break and I don't want to put any pressure on the guy," added
Williams, who has caddied for Woods since 1999, including 13 of his 14 major
victories.

 "He will know in his mind, and his family will know in
their mind, when it is the right time for him to return to playing golf," he
told the newspaper.

 "He will have the right people counselling him
and between the people that counsel him, his wife and his immediate friends,
when he is ready to come back he will be ready to come back."

 The New
Zealander said that while he and Woods were good friends off the course, they
did not spend much time together outside of the weeks he was
competing.

 "I had no knowledge of what Tiger's indiscretion was,"
said Williams who lives in New Zealand. "I am an honest person. I had no
knowledge of what was going on. If I did, I would say I did."
