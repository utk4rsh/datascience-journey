 China's superstar athlete
and former world record holder Liu Xiang has made "serious preparation" for the
ongoing East Asian Games in Hong Kong, his coach said, as he makes his way back
from injury. 

 The biggest name at the Games, Liu, a former Olympic
110-metre hurdles champion, arrived in Hong Kong on Wednesday sporting a face
mask. 

 "His form is fine after some serious preparation, but we are
not too concerned about how fast he runs as long as he wins the gold," coach Sun
Haiping was quoted as saying by the South China Morning Post. 

 The
face mask was to prevent Liu picking up any germs on the flight from Shanghai,
Sun said. 

 The 26-year-old Liu is yet to recover top form after an
Achilles tendon injury, which forced him to pull out of last year's Beijing
Olympics and saw him undergo surgery in the United States in December 2008.


 The heats and final of the 110m hurdles are on Friday, with fellow
Chinese Ji Wei expected to be Liu's closest rival. 

 Despite not being
back to peak form, it would be a major shock if Liu does not take gold.


 The East Asian Games end on December 13.
