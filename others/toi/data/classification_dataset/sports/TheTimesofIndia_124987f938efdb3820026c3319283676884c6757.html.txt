 Australia's former dual world
record holder Eamon Sullivan said Monday he is suffering complications from an
appendix operation which is restricting his training. 

 The Beijing
Olympic 100-metre freestyle silver medallist had the operation two months ago
and had been forced to train lightly with the national squad in Canberra over
the last three days. 

 "I'm still not feeling right from the appendix
surgery and a couple of the muscles are just not right, so I'm just going to try
and get some more scans to see when I can start pushing it again," Sullivan said
in a Swimming Australia statement. 

 "I only had three days off after
the operation which probably wasn't ideal, but I was up at high altitude and
wanted to get the benefits of being up there. 

 "So I'm just going
through the process now of finding out what I can, and can't do and trying to
make sure I do the right thing now." 

 Sullivan, 24, who missed this
year's world championships in Rome due to a virus, also struggled with a
shoulder injury and cannot wait for a fresh start to 2010. 

 "It
hasn't been the best year by any means with hip surgery, sickness, a few
injections in the shoulder and now the appendix," he said. "It's been up and
down. 

 "I'm waiting for the year to tick over, wipe the slate clean
and try and start again next year with hopefully some better luck and some steps
in place to make sure things like this don't happen again." 

 Sullivan
held both the 50m and 100m freestyle world records before he lost them to French
swimmer Frederick Bousquet and Brazilian Cesar Cielo this year.
