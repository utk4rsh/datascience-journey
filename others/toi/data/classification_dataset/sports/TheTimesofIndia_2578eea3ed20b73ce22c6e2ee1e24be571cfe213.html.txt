 Manchester United
assistant manager Mike Phelan has hinted that the Premier League champions could
make a move to sign Wolfsburg striker Edin Dzeko. 

 Dzeko, 23, has
been linked with a host of top clubs from around Europe since helping Wolfsburg
win the German league title last season. 

 The Bosnian, who has 14
goals in 23 appearances for his country, scored against United when the sides
met in the Champions League earlier this season and Phelan has admitted the club
have been looking at him since because he has the ideal style for the English
game. 

 "I'm sure there are a number of teams looking at him. Are we
one on them? We are looking at talent all of the time and we are in there with
the rest of them," Phelan said. 

 "He showed his threat in the game at
Old Trafford and he appeals because he is a tall, skilful boy and in some ways
he is an ideal player for the English league. 

 "He has stature, his
feet are good and he is producing some good performances. I am sure everybody
has looked at him."
