 An official announcement of
a Floyd Mayweather Jr and Manny Pacquiao fight is expected to come on Monday
after a venue for the world welterweight title fight is decided, according to
Pacquiao promoter Bob Arum. 

 "I'm very optimistic that everything
will come together and we'll have an announcement by next Monday," Arum said in
a telephone interview on Tuesday. 

 "I think it's going to be the
biggest fight of all time, certainly from a revenue standpoint. It could gross a
couple of hundred million (US dollars)." 

 The pair are considered the
best pound-for-pound boxers in the world. 

 American Mayweather, who
has won titles at five different weight classes, has a 40-0 record. Filipino
Pacquiao improved to 50-3-2 when he became the first to win titles in seven
classes when he stopped Miguel Cotto last month to win the WBO welterweight
crown. 

 Arum said both fighters were on board for a March 13 clash
that could generate hundreds of millions of dollars and become the biggest ever
boxing promotion. 

 "We don't want to do an official announcement
until we know where the fight's going to be held," said Arum. "That's what we're
exploring this week. 

 "Tomorrow we'll be in Dallas visiting with (NFL
Dallas Cowboys owner) Jerry Jones at Cowboys Stadium and hopefully by Monday of
next week we'll have a venue and a deal in place. 

 "I know that Jerry
Jones has really worked on the possibility and that's why we're meeting with him
tomorrow." 

 The new $1.3 billion Cowboys Stadium seats about 73,000.
Arum said there were other contenders to host the bout. "There's the MGM in Las
Vegas. In Las Vegas, that is the only possibility because the outdoor stadium
will not work in March. 

 "We have heard but haven't really explored
the (Louisiana) Superdome in New Orleans and the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.
