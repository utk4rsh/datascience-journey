 South Korea's new Formula One
circuit is on schedule to be finished by July next year ahead of the country's
debut in October, organisers said on Thursday. 

 "It is totally on
plan," Kevin Lee, general manager of strategic planning, said at a Monaco
motorsport business forum. 

 "We have a plan to finish the whole
construction work at the circuit on July 5 next year and up until now it is
roughly 60 percent done," he added. 

 "We work together with other
people, (Hermann) Tilke is our engineering consultant and they are very happy
with the progress of the construction at the circuit," said Lee. "We are on
schedule for next year." 

 The official Formula One calendar is due to
be published on Friday with South Korea's arrival expanding the championship to
a record-equalling 19 races from 17 this year. Canada is also returning after a
year's absence. 

 The Korea Auto Valley Operation (KAVO) is building a
3.4 mile track on the coast of the southwestern region of South Cholla province
some 300-350km (185-215 miles) from Seoul. 

 The October 17 race is
due to take place in daylight hours although Lee said organisers, who are
expecting a 120,000-strong race day crowd, might consider moving to a night-time
slot in a few years' time. 

 Cruise liners may have to be rented to
provide additional hotel rooms but local accommodation was guaranteed for teams
and Formula One personnel.
