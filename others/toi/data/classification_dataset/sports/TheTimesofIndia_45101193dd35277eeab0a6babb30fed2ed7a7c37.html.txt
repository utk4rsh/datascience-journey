 A Pakistan Cricket Board
member, who had accused India of influencing the umpires to ensure Pakistan's
defeat in the Champions Trophy semi-final against New Zealand, has refused to
respond to a PCB notice seeking explanation for his statement. 

 The
PCB was taken to task by the ICC for the statement made by Shah which prompted
the Board to send a notice asking him to explain on what basis he made the
statement. 

 Shah, who heads the Karachi City Cricket Association, had
alleged that the Indian lobby was responsible for influencing the umpiring
mistakes in the semi-final that cost Pakistan the match. He had raised doubts
over some of the decisions by Australian umpire Simon Taufel. 

 "I
have sent a four line reply to the board today that the chief operating officer
Wasim Bari is not authorised to ask any explanation from me," Shah said on
Monday.

 "I have said in my letter that the governing council appoints
the chief operating officer so he cannot issue notices to any member. Only the
Chairman is authorised to seek any explanation from me," he added.


 Shah said he had his reasons for making the statement and he would
only explain them to PCB Chairman Ejaz Butt. 

 Shah is likely to be
grilled for his statement at a meeting of the Governing council on October
19.
