 The China Agricultural University (CAU) has a brand-new
Gymnasium and was delivered to the wrestling's international governing body
(FILA). The complex spans an area of nearly 24,000 square meters.
 
 The
venue also hosted the 2007 Junior World Wrestling Championship. It will also
play host to the volleyball seating competition during the Beijing Paralympic
Games, which will be held from 6 to 18 September 2008.
 
 The
gymnasium's rooftop has a staggered, stair-like design. The skylights provide
enough lighting for daytime activities. The gym has no suspended ceiling and
exposed pipes have been painted red and silver.
 
 After the Beijing
Games, the venue will serve as a multi-functional facility accessible to
university students and staff, as well as the residents in the
neighborhood.
