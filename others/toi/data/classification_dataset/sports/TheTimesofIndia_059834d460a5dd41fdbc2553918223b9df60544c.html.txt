 At the end of 11th round of
47th Premier National Chess Championship IM Vidit Gujrathi of Maharashtra upset
GM Neelotpal Das. GM Neelotpal Das, playing with white, started the game with
Slav defense. The game was equally poised till the 22nd move. 

 On the
next move, Neelotpal played his rook to e1 which gave a slight advantage to
Vidit. On the 24th move, Neelotpal made a blunder by moving his Bishop to e4.
After this move, Vidit got a bishop and knight extra for his rook. In the
endgame, it was an easy win for Vidit.

 With this win, Vidit had moved
to 3rd place, with IM B Adhiban on the first place with 8.5 points, followed by
IM Sriram Jha on 2nd place with 8 points.

 The game between IM S P
Sethuraman and GM R R Laxman started with Nimzo Indian Defense. On 22nd move,
instead of moving the knight, Laxman played his rook, which was a bad ploy by
Laxman. When Laxman saw a mate is unavoidable, he accepted his defeat in 28
moves.

 The top 3 games ended in a quick draw.
