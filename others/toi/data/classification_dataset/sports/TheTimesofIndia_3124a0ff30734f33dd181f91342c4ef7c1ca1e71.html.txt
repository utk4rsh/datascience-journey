 Defending champion Jeev Milkha
Singh was just two strokes off the pace at tied second after turning in a
brilliant five-under 65 in the penultimate round of the Golf Nippon Series JT
Cup on Saturday. 

 Jeev is five-under 205 overall behind Kyung-Tae
Kim, who carded a 64 on Saturday. 

 It was not an ideal start to the
day for Jeev as he stumbled to a double bogey on the very first hole. But the
Indian got his act together soon enough with birdies on the second and third.


 A couple of more birdies on the sixth and ninth followed as Jeev
made the turn two-under. 

 His good form continued in the back nine as
well and Jeev gained shots on the 10th and 12th holes. A dropped shot on the
13th did pull him back a bit but he more than made up for it with birdies on the
15th and 18th. 

 Toshinori Muto shared the second spot with Jeev after
carding a 66.
