 Bangladesh have recalled four
players who appeared in the Indian Cricket League (ICL) for their preliminary
squad for a tri-series in Dhaka in January. 

 A "cooling off" period
for Shahriar Nafees, Aftab Ahmed, Alok Kapali and Dhiman Ghosh expires on
December 31, the Bangladesh Cricket Board said on Saturday.

 The
tri-nation One-Day International series involving hosts Bangladesh, India and
Sri Lanka takes place from January 4 to 13.

 The quartet were part of
the Bangladesh squad before they opted to join the ICL's Dhaka Warriors,
comprising of 14 players from Bangladesh. The BCB subsequently banned them for
10 years. 

 However, all Bangladeshi ICL cricketers terminated their
contracts with the unauthorised Twenty20 league in June to accept an amnesty
offered by the BCB.
