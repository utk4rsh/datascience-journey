 Japan manager Takeshi Okada has
backed midfield playmaker Shunsuke Nakamura to regain form and help the national
team meet its goal of reaching the 2010 World Cup semi-finals. 

 Japan
has a difficult draw for the World Cup, facing tough first-round opponents in
the Netherlands, Cameroon and Denmark, yet Okada has set the lofty goal of a
position in the final four. 

 Nakamura, the most renowned of Japanese
players after his spells in Italy and with Celtic in Scotland, had struggled
since switching to Spanish side Espanyol this season. He is yet to score in ten
appearances. 

 "He (Nakamura) made this decision before the World Cup
to go to Spain and there was a certain amount of risk involved," Okada said
Thursday. 

 "However, when I consider his decision I actually admire
him deeply for it. He will not take the easy option; he will always try to find
the more challenging choice." 

 Okada, who also coached Japan in the
1998 tournament, praised the level of African teams, saying that while they
aren't quite at level of top contenders Spain and Brazil, " they definitely have
potential to aim at being No. 1 in the world."
