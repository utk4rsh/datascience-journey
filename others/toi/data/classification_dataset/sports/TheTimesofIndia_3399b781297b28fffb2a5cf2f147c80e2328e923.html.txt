 David Beckham is the key in
selling England's struggling bid for the 2018 World Cup and he must be used at
every opportunity, according to FIFA president Sepp Blatter. 

 Blatter
met Beckham in Cape Town ahead of England's presentation of their bid
credentials to the world's media and football's powerbrokers here this week.


 The FIFA chief was quoted by Sky Sports as saying the
"Beckham-brand" should be milked mercilessly as it could make the difference
between success and failure. 

 "They have to use him for everything,
forever. If they don't they are not very intelligent," he said.


 "I've been working in FIFA for 35 years and I know a good guy for
big occasions. 

 "He's one of the most important figures in football.
He has a personal charisma that very few players have. He's a great man.


 "Perhaps he is not the best player in the world but he is a good guy
and he is also the best ambassador for fair play in football."


 Beckham, who hopes to be in Fabio Capello's squad for the 2010 World
Cup, has taken on the role of official ambassador for England's bid in an
attempt to convince the FIFA executive committee to award them a first World Cup
since 1966. 

 The LA Galaxy star is due to meet senior FIFA members
here this week with England's bid under pressure after English Premier League
chairman Dave Richards resigned from the board. 

 His move came as
David Triesman, chairman of both the bid and England's Football Association,
came under fire for having a dual role which his critics maintain does not leave
him with enough time to do both jobs properly. 

 England are up
against Australia, Indonesia, Japan, Netherlands-Belgium, Russia, and
Spain-Portugal for the 2018 World Cup with a decision made a year from now.
