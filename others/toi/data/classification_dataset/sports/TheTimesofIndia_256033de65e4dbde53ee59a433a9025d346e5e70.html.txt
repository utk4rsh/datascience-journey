 An angry state sports
minister shot off a letter to BCCI president alleging black-marketing of tickets
for India-Australia One-dayer as irate fans staged protest outside the Rajiv
Gandhi stadium on Thursday. 

 Fans who could not buy tickets for the
fifth encounter in the seven-match series staged a protest before the start of
the match. 

 Sports Minister Komatireddy Venkat Reddy pointed fingers
at working of the Hyderabad Cricket Association which he said was not
transparent as far as sale of match-tickets was concerned. 

 "This
(black-marketing of tickets) is causing grave concern and disappointment among
cricket lovers in the state and embarrassment to the government," Reddy's
missive read. 

 "There are a lot of complaints and also news reports
in the media regarding the sale of tickets in the black market. The HCA has not
even been following protocol in relation to the government functionaries despite
securing huge concessions from the state government," the Minister said.


 Reddy said the government had given 22 acres of prime land to the
Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) for the construction of the stadium at
Uppal. 

 He said he would talk personally to BCCI chief Shashank
Manohar on the issue.
