 Los Angeles Galaxy
forward Landon Donovan signed a four-year contract extension Wednesday with the
Major League Soccer club, paving the way for a loan to Everton of the English
Premiership. 

 Donovan, this year's Most Valuable Player of the US
league, is set to stay with the Galaxy through 2013 after scoring a team-high 12
goals this season and together with England's David Beckham leading the team to
the MLS Cup finals. 

 The Galaxy announced their captain would be
allowed to pursue overseas loan deals provided he returns for the start of the
2010 MLS season on March 27. Donovan said he would not have signed a deal
without that provision. 

 "I am excited to be able to pledge my future
to the Galaxy by signing this new contract," Donovan said. "This is a great day
for me both personally and professionally." 

 Galaxy coach Bruce Arena
said that while no loan deal has been completed, one likely would be done with
Everton from January to mid-March. Everton already features a top US talent,
goalkeeper Tim Howard. 

 That would allow Donovan to get a first-hand
look for at least 10 weeks at the talent he and his US teammates will face June
12 in their World Cup opener against England, while at the same time giving
English talent a better look at the American playmaker whom Beckham knows well.


 Beckham is on a loan deal to AC Milan that does not require his
return until after the World Cup. 

 Donovan, 27, is not available for
transfer, Arena said. 

 "He is our captain, our leader and the
league's MVP and we believe that Landon signing this new contract is a key
aspect to bringing the Galaxy further success both on and off the field," Arena
said.
