 Siddharth Suchde moved 10
places to end the year at 99 in the PSA world squash rankings.


 Siddharth's jump was due to his runner-up result at the recently
concluded US$6,000 BC Open in Canada. 

 By virtue of this, Siddharth
moves into the second position in the list of Indians behind Saurav Ghosal who
is at 32, having gained a spot, according to a press release from the Squash
Racquets Federation of India. 

 Harinder Pal Sandhu, winner at the PSA
Indian Challenger 5 tournament here earlier this year, also progressed by one
position to 101 for his best-ever ranking so far. However, Ritwik Bhattacharya
slipped to 141. 

 Indian's top two women players, Joshana Chinappa and
Dipika Pallikal had minimal movements in their ranking while Anaka Alankamony,
Aparajitha Balamurukan and Anwesha Reddy have had significant movements due to
the Indian Challenger 3 in Chennai.
