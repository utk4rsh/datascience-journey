 Blackburn manager Sam Allardyce
was unable to defeat his long-time assistant Phil Brown as Rovers ground out a
goalless draw at Hull on Saturday. 

 Allardyce employed Hull boss
Brown as his number two at Bolton and the pair clearly know each other's tactics
inside out judging by this dour struggle. 

 Brown was visible
throughout on the touchline but Allardyce, recovering from a recent heart
operation, remained in the stands until the closing moments. 

 There
was precious little goalmouth action at either end and Hull remain two places
and three points above the relegation zone, while Blackburn are five points
ahead of the bottom three. 

 Blackburn's South African striker Benni
McCarthy shot over with an early free-kick and then volleyed home David
Hoilett's cross, only to see his effort ruled out for offside. 

 Hull
wasted a glorious opportunity in the 10th minute after Franco di Santo was
robbed in midfield by George Boateng. The Dutchman played in Craig Fagan with a
perfect throughball but the forward, one on one with Paul Robinson, shot too
close to the goalkeeper. 

 George Boateng tried his luck early in the
second half with a long-range effort at the other end but Robinson saved
comfortably. 

 Hull were fuming when they had a penalty appeal turned
down with 16 minutes remaining. 

 Substitute striker Jozy Altidore,
introduced eight minutes earlier, appeared to have been tripped by Christopher
Samba's challenge but referee Chris Foy penalised the American for diving.


 Hull responded by introducing Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and the
Dutch forward had two late chances, shooting straight at Robinson and then
heading wide when he should at least have tested the Rovers goalkeeper.
