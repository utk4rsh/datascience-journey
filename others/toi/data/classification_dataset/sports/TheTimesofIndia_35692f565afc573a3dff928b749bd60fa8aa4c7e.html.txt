 Spanish tennis star Rafael
Nadal says his football-playing countrymen must remain humble despite being
drawn in a seemingly unthreatening World Cup group alongside Honduras, Chile and
Switzerland.

 "It is not a bad draw for us," he said after beating
Tomas Berdych in the opening singles match of the Davis Cup final against the
Czech Republic here on Friday, a game which ended shortly before the World Cup
draw took place in Cape Town. 

 "You know, everybody right now is
talking about how Spain are going to win. I think that's not positive for us.


 "We know how tough it is to win a World Cup. So we have a very
complete team. I think we are definitely one of the favourites. But we must be
calm and humble." 

 Spain, the reigning European champions, will go
into the tournament in South Africa next summer as one of the favourites after a
flawless qualifying campaign in which they won all 10 of their matches.


 Nadal, though, feels they cannot afford to underestimate the threat
posed by the other heavyweights at the four-yearly football showpiece.


 "The other favourites? England for sure, Brazil. The same as always,
no?" said the world number two. 

 "Italy. Argentina. Portugal have a
good team. Yeah, a lot of teams can win."
