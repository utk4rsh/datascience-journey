 New Zealand sports
broadcaster Sky TV will screen on Tuesday an eight-minute interview with Tiger
Woods recently in Australia, in which he talks about the importance in his life
of his wife and family.

 In a 30-second trailer for the interview,
which was filmed shortly before Woods became embroiled in rumors of multiple
extramarital affairs, interviewer Murray Deaker asks Woods, "Family first and
golf second. Always be like that?" Woods replies, "Always."

 The
one-on-one interview was arranged by Woods' New Zealand caddie Steve Williams
and conducted last month in Melbourne, where Woods won the Australian
Masters.

 Sky intended to screen the interview on Christmas Day but
brought it forward to Tuesday when it recognized its significance in light of
recent revelations about Woods' private life.

 The network is touting
the exclusive interview as "the story that won't wait."

 Deaker told
New Zealand media on Sunday that he asked Woods directly about the importance in
his life of his Swedish-born wife Elin and their two young children. According
to media who have seen a preview of the interview, Woods speaks about family
values and the way in which being a father has affected his approach to
golf.

 "We have to be conscious of the fact it was conducted before
all this blew up. And given what we now know everyone will draw their own
conclusions to his answers," Deaker told the Sunday Star-Times
newspaper.

 Deaker said he had received several offers from overseas
media outlets for the interview but had refused to sell.
