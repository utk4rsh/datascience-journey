 Luxembourg-based investor
Gerard Lopez has confirmed he is a candidate to take over the Renault Formula
One team, whose future will be decided in Paris on Thursday. 

 "There
are cycles," Lopez said here Wednesday at the Motor Sport Business Forum, a
conference for stakeholders and sponsors of F1 and motorsport. 

 "The
current situation in F1, this period of change, creates opportunities for new
teams and new investors. 

 "If we take over Renault F1, it will be in
its entirety, as a team manufacturer," added Lopez, the founder of Mangrove
Capital Partners and the president of Genii Capital, which have both invested in
new internet technologies in recent years. 

 Despite his stated
interest in Renault, Lopez has also admitted to interest in "another F1 team".


 Renault F1's new owners are expected to be named following a board
meeting of the French company in Paris on Thursday. 

 The only other
known candidate to take over the brand is British motorsport entrepreneur David
Richards, owner of the Prodrive motorsport team and chairman of British luxury
car-maker Aston Martin. 

 Unlike Lopez, Richards has previous F1
experience, having previously run the Benetton and British American Racing
teams. 

 There has been speculation over Renault's future in F1 ever
since the FIA, motorsport's governing body, issued a lifetime ban in September
to their former team principal Flavio Briatore for ordering Nelson Piquet Junior
to deliberately crash at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix. 

 Pat Symonds,
Renault's former chief engineer, was banned for five years. 

 Both men
are currently appealing against their respective punishments. 

 Even
without the fall-out from that scandal, worldwide economic problems have also
called into question Renault's continued involvement in the sport during a
12-month period where other volume car manufacturers such as Honda, BMW and
Toyota have all pulled out of Formula One.
