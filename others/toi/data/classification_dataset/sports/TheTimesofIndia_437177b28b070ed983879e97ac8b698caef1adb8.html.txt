 A disciplinary panel
determined that Jamaican star Asafa Powell and five others would not be punished
further for skipping a training session ahead of the IAAF World Athletics
Championships.

 The group, which includes former world record holder
Powell and women's 100m Olympic champion Shelly-Ann Fraser, skipped Jamaica's
main athletics training camp just prior to the August 15-23 Worlds. The others
include Olympic 400m hurdle champion Melaine Walker, hurdlers Kaliese Spencer
and Brigitte Foster-Hylton and 400m sprinter Shericka Williams.

 "A
sanction was imposed against the offenders and at the instance of the president
of the IAAF, the sanction was withdrawn," the panel wrote in a letter to the
Jamaican Amateur Athletic Association.

 "To attempt to revisit the
matter would be tantamount to trying them twice."

 The panel
recommended that coaches communicate better and work closer with the JAAA.


 "Something needs to be done to get the coaches to be more
cooperative. They need to understand that it is the JAAA that is invited to
these meets and the athletes only become eligible to participate if selected by
the JAAA."

 The panel includes former Jamaica Chief Justice Lensley
Wolfe, former Attorney General of Jamaica Winston Spaulding and Chief of Staff
of the Jamaica Defence Force major general John Simmonds.

 Jamaican
track officials initially ruled the six would not be allowed to run at the
worlds then made a dramatic U-turn after being pressured by the
IAAF.

 The group, who are all part of the Maximising Velocity Power
(MVP) training group, had been punished by the team directors because they
refused to train with the main body of the team in Nuremberg,
Germany.

 Instead they stayed with their coach Stephen Francis at
their Italian training camp in Lignano Sabbiadoro.
