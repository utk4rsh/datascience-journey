
 HAMILTON,
Jan 9:

  New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming won the toss and decided to
bowl first in the deciding one-day match with Sri Lanka at Seddon Park on
Tuesday.

 New Zealand is hoping to move on from the humiliation of
being bundled out for 73 in the fourth match in Auckland on
Saturday.

 The score was New Zealand's second lowest one-day total
ever and its worst losing margin of 189 runs.

 The return of batsman
Nathan Astle and in-form all rounder James Franklin should strengthen the
batting line-up. They replace Hamish Marshall, who will be 12th man, and
all-rounder Andre Adams.

 All-rounder Daniel Vettori also comes back
into the team after missing the previous match through illness, taking the place
of fellow spinner Jeetan Patel.

 Sri Lanka is playing with the same
line-up which achieved the huge victory in Auckland. The two teams are locked
2-2 in the five match series.

 The start of the match was delayed by
rain
showers.
