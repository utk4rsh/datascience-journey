 Steve Stricker fired an eagle
on the 17th hole as he and fellow American Jerry Kelly combined for a 26-under
190 to win the $ 3 million Shark Shootout by one stroke.

 The pair
shot a final day 13-under 59 with the help of Stricker's eagle putt on the
par-five 17. He also hit the second shot on the hole at the Tiburon golf
course.

 Stricker and Kelly earned $750,000 in prize money to share
between them.

 They clinched the win when Kenny Perry and J.B. Holmes
failed to birdie the 18th hole.

 Heading into Sunday's play Kelly and
Stricker had a one-shot lead.

 This was the second win in this event
for Kelly who paired with Rod Pampling to take the 2006 title. Stricker won for
the first time.

 The final round was played in a better-ball scramble
format. The pairing played the best shot from each player until the hole was
completed.

 Dubbed the Shark Shootout it was begun by Aussie Greg
Norman 21 years ago.

 Five of the dozen teams broke 60 on the par-72
course.

 Tim Clark, who posted a hole-in-one, and Chad Campbell shot a
15-under 57 that was just two strokes shy of the tournament's scramble
record.

 The early clubhouse lead went to Clark and Campbell at
25-under 191.

 Justin Leonard and Scott Verplank joined them with a
59, while Perry and Holmes also shot a 59 for a three-way tie for second
place.
