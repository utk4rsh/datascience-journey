 The Coordination Commission
(CoCom) of the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) has begun the process of
evaluating Delhi's preparations for the 2010 Games. 

 CoCom chairman
Austin Sealy, who has visited some of the venues in the last couple of days,
said he has started taking stock of the situation. 

 "All I can say is
that the process has started. It is too early to speak to the media," he told
IANS. 

 The seven-member CoCom will be briefed by different agencies
on the current status of work and the Organising Committee (OC) will make a
presentation on operational matters. 

 CoCom member Michael Hopper
said he and Sealy visited the Games village and the Indira Gandhi Stadium
Friday. 

 Hopper said that Sealy has visited some more venues
Saturday. 

 "There is a noticeable progress in work after the whole
issue came into the limelight. But we will get a clear picture when the OC and
various agencies make their presentations," Hooper said. 

 The
three-day exercise beginning Monday will critically review of the progress of
work. 

 "There are a wide range of issues related to completion of
venues and on the operations that will be discussed during the CoCom meeting. We
will analyse everything," Hooper said. 

 Interestingly, Sports
Minister M. S. Gill has himself gone around some of the venues to get a first
hand knowledge of the works in progress. 

 The CoCom will take a
couple of weeks to table its report to the Commonwealth Games Federation
executive board. But before that, they will also give their inputs to CGF chief
Michael Fennell, who will arrive next week. 

 A decision will also be
taken on setting up of an independent review panel to monitor the monthly
progress of the work for the Games, a move that was rejected by the Organising
Committee.
