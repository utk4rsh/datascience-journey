 The Swedish Football
Federation says the Swedish and Norwegian governments won't fund the countries'
joint bid to host the 2016 European Championship.

 The football
federation said late on Wednesday the governments declined to help
municipalities fund the necessary arena investments. The decision is expected to
be formalized by the governments later, but the date has not yet been
set.

 Although municipalities could finance the investments
themselves, the FA says it will be impossible to host the event if the
governments' plans are formalized.

 Candidates to host Euro 2016 must
have nine 30,000-capacity stadiums and return their bid dossiers to UEFA by
February 15.

 The UEFA Executive Committee will decide the host in
May.
