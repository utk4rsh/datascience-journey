 With no-fly zones being declared in some areas of the national Capital
ahead of the SAARC summit, security was further beefed up following input from
an external intelligence gathering agency that four militants had sneaked into
the Capital to cause
disruption.

 Amid threat
perception from Pakistan-based militant groups and the LTTE, security agencies
decided to declare the hotels where the delegates would be staying as "no-fly"
zones to ward off any aerial
attack.

 The summit comes after
an aerial attack by the LTTE against the Sri Lankan Air Force last
week.

 Meanwhile, a series of
raids were being carried out by police in Badarpur area for militants of
Harkat-ul-Jehadi Islamia of Bangladesh, who had reportedly infiltrated into the
country.

 An intelligence input
received from the external intelligence gathering agency had warned that four
HuJI militants had sneaked in and would attempt to disrupt the SAARC summit
which will be attended by heads of
states.

 Delhi Police sources
said spotters from various militancy-infested states had been placed at the
entry and exit points to identify anti-national elements wanting to enter the
national capital.

 So far there
had been no success, the sources said, adding that the HuJI may like to disrupt
the meet following last week's execution of some of the militants by the interim
government in Bangladesh.

 The
summit being held on April 3-4 was being attended by Afghan President Hamid
Karzai, Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, Sri Lankan President Mahinda
Rajapakse, Nepalese Prime Minister G P Koirala, Maldives President Maumoon Abdul
Gayoom, Bangaldesh chief advisor Fakhruddin Ahmed and Bhutan Prime Minister
Khandu Wangchuk.
