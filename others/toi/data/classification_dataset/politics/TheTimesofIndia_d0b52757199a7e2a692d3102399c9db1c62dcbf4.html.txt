 Sarabjit Singh's family
members, who crossed over to Pakistan via Wagah border on Wednesday afternoon,
have got permission to meet the Indian national in Lahore's Kot Lakhpat
jail.

 Sarabjit's wife Sukhpreet Kaur and his daughters Swapandeep and
Poonam, who arrived in Lahore along with his sister Dalbir Kaur and her husband
Baldev Singh, were awaiting permission to meet him in the Kot Lakhpat jail.


 "The home department of Punjab province has given us permission to
go and meet Sarabjit and we will shortly be leaving for Lahore," Sarabjit's
sister Dalbir Kaur told PTI. 

 Dalbir said she had spoken to the
Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi about their request to meet Sarabjit and
also permission to go to Islamabad to meet top Pakistani leaders like Prime
Minister Yousuf Raza Gillani. 

 She said she had also sent a request
to former premier and PML-N Nawaz Sharif to intervene in the matter and to help
the family meet the jailed Indian. 

 Sarabjit's family insists that he
is innocent and was wrongly convicted for the bomb attacks. 

 The
Indian national, who Pakistan claims is Manjit Singh, was sentenced to death in
1991. His mercy petition was rejected by Musharraf on March 3.


 Sarabjit was originally set to be hanged on April
1.

 Pakistan's Supreme Court too rejected Sarabjit's plea for clemency
in March 2006. 

 His family denies he is a spy as claimed by Pakistan
and insists he accidentally strayed into Pakistani territory while
inebriated.
