 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has assured UPA allies of regular
consultation on significant issues. The assurance is aimed at quelling any
anxiety that the government, fresh from its victory in the hard-fought battle
with the opposition, may feel encouraged to resort to unilateralism of the kind
that it has displayed on the nuclear
deal.

 The assurance came at a
meeting the PM had with Congress leaders, UPA partners and the new ally,
Samajwadi Party. This must have comforted the allies who narrowly escaped a
defeat in Lok Sabha that would have pushed them into an election they were not
prepared to fight.

 Amid all the
celebrations over what the PM called an "impressive victory" in the trust vote,
Congress managers recognize that they had near-certain defeat staring at them
till Saturday when they managed to pull Jharkhand Mukti Morcha away from
NDAâ€™s waiting arms.


 "Till then, we were sure of
only 258 votes with the opposition having an edge. Our success with JMM gave us
a breather that tilted the game our way despite the last- minute jolts from Ajit
Singh and H D Deve Gowda," a key member of the crack team said.
