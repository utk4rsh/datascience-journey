 Some of the mist over Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's promise of "fair
share" for minorities in government jobs could be lifting. Congress on Monday
took ownership of proposals for quota benefits for Dalit Muslims and Christians
aired by two senior Congress leaders A R Antulay and Veerappa
Moily.

 Antulay, who is minister
for minority affairs, and Moily, chairman of Administrative Reforms Commission,
have spoken in favour of reservations for Muslims. Antulay advocated inclusion
of Dalit Muslims in the SC/ST quota
frame.

 Moily, who is also a
member of CWC, said reservation for Muslims should have been included in the
Constitution. Even as Congress maintains that it is opposed to reservations
based on religious lines there is a legal bar to implementing such a proposal it
has begun to take ownership of proposals to expand access of minorities to
quotas. 

 Though the PM's office
had been quick to state, albeit off the record, that "fair share" did not mean
quotas, enlarging the reservation envelope for minorities is pretty much part of
Congress's strategic
thinking.

 Given that a bid by
Congress-ruled Andhra Pradesh's move to reserve 5% jobs for Muslims was stayed
by the high court and this has not been vacated by Supreme Court, the party's
thinking seems to be to nibble around the judicial bar. The attempt to stir a
debate on reservations for Dalit Muslims and Christians is a step in that
direction.

 BJP lashed at what
it called a blatant attempt to implement communal reservations. Terming the move
as "another shameful attempt" to enforce communal quotas, BJP chief Rajnath
Singh said that the political design was unfortunate in view of the recent
judicial pause on the Andhra proposal.
