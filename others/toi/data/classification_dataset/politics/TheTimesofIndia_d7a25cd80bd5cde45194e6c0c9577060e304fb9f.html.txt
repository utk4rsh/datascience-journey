 BJP was on Monday put in a spot over its Bharat Ratna demand for Atal
Bihari Vajpayee with its ally in Orissa, the BJD, saying it was writing to the
Centre for conferring the highest civilian honour on Biju
Patnaik.

 Across the political
spectrum, the RJD demanded the award for former Bihar CM and socialist leader
Karpoori Thakur and Union minister Ramvilas Paswan said it should be given to
Jagjivan Ram, Mohammed Rafi and Marathi thinker Jyotiba
Phule.

 Orissa CM Naveen Patnaik
said in Bhubaneswar a formal request for honouring his father would be placed
before the Centre soon. "Many people in Orissa and also in other parts of the
country want the Bharat Ratna for Biju Babu. This has been their demand for
several years. We will make the request in a dignified and proper manner," said
Naveen Patnaik.

 BJD leaders
joining the chorus for Bharat Ratna has put the state unit of BJP on a tricky
wicket: they cannot go against the party line and demand the award for Biju
Patnaik and at the same time cannot afford to brush aside the alliance partner's
demand considering the coalition dharma and possible political
ramifications.

 Orissa BJP
president Suresh Pujari said there was strength in the BJD's demand. "Biju Babu
was a great man and his contributions to Indian politics, development of Orissa
and also the Indonesian Independence struggle is known to all," Pujari
said.
