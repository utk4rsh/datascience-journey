 Mukherjee, however, said he
did not want to be a political astrologer and comment on whether the Congress
will do business with the Left parties again in the future. 

 "These
four years, despite difference of perceptions and divergence of views we carried
on. For the Left parties, I have sad feelings but no bitterness," he told a news
channel. 

 "We have no hard feelings, to be frank...I have no
bitterness towards the Left leaders and Left leaders too have never attacked me
personally," Mukherjee, the government's chief negotiator with the Left on the
nuclear deal, said. 

 Asked whether Congress will be open to do
business with the Left parties after next elections, he said, "how can I say
right now. Let us wait, how circumstances will unfold. Let us not predict and be
political astrologers. I do not keep options open and do not keep options
closed."
