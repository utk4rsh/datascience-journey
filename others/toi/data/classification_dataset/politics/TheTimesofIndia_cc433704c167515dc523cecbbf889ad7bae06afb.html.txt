 In a startling revelation,
BJP on Friday claimed that as many as 50 of its MPs were "contacted" to vote in
favour of the government. 

 "Fifty of our MPs were contacted and
offers were made by the other side. The party appreciates that the offers were
rejected and three of them even came out to expose it," deputy leader of the BJP
in the Lok Sabha, Vijay Kumar Malhotra, told reporters here on Friday.


 He, however, said the party was "ashamed" of the eight MPs who
cross-voted or abstained during the trust vote. 

 Announcing that the
three MPs, Ashok Argal (Madhya Pradesh), Faggan Singh Kulaste (Madhya Pradesh)
and Mahavir Bagora (Rajasthan) have given a written complaint to the office of
the Speaker, Malhotra said his party demanded a copy of the CD of the sting
operation submitted by the channel. 

 "We have also requested the
Speaker's office to provide a copy of the sting operation CD so that people
could see it and the truth could be revealed," he said. 

 Malhotra
denied any role of the party in the sting operation which allegedly recorded
aides of a government ally party handing over cash to the three MPs to vote in
favour of the government. 

 Parliament on Tuesday witnessed high drama
during the trust vote when Argal, Kulaste and Bagora reached the well of the
House with bags full of cash, each carrying one crore, and displayed it to the
Speaker claiming that the currency notes were given to them by the treasury
benches to cross-vote. 

 Malhotra, however, agreed that the act of
displaying the cash in House was done by the MPs with permission from the party
including senior party leader L K Advani.
