 As the railway station here
teems with refugees, the images are stark, poignant and also reminiscent. The
scenes of displaced needing shelter, food medicines and even clothes are a
throwback to 1971: of refugees pouring in from erstwhile East
Pakistan.

 The faces of defeat and resignation one sees all around
also evoke memories of Indian troops being battered by the Chinese in NEFA,
1962. These refugees of 2008, too, have been done in by an "enemy" closer home:
Kosi.

 And just as the crises of '62 and '71 evoked an overwhelming
response from the people, the same people have once again stood up to be counted
in this hour of national calamity in Bihar.

 For almost three weeks,
people are pouring in at this railhead for another long journey to cities north:
Delhi, Amritsar, Jalandhar and Gurgaon. Mohammad Shamshul Hoda, 70, pushed out
of tailoring because of cataract, has finally reached his marooned
Bhathni-Pathraha village in Madhepura. A raft of empty drums and bamboo carried
his family of 13, including a grandchild born just two days earlier, to a seven
hour sail across three river streams to Ramnagar. 

 Waiting for a
train to Delhi, Hoda finds peace in reading the Quran. The gods are not unkind,
after all. His children are rushing to help the homeless. "The children have got
Chura and biscuits. I'm fasting but this call on the loudspeaker inviting me to
break my Ramzan roza came as Allahâ€™s voice," Hoda's eyes are moist,
"Hindus provided the Iftaar." "We have wound up our food court at the station as
most refugees have taken a train out," said Anil Chamaria, president of the
North-Eastern Bihar chamber of Commerce and Industries, the Iftaar host.


 This effort isn't limited to professionals and traders. Sex workers
ran a community kitchen for three days.
