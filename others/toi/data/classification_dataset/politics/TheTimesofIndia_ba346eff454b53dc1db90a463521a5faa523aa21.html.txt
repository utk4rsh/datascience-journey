 India on Thursday said it
will react to Pakistan's response to the dossier on Mumbai attacks after
receiving and studying it. 

 "Our High Commissioner to Pakistan will
be going to the Foreign Office later in the day when we expect to receive a
formal report. When the response is available, we will study it and react
further," External Affairs Ministry spokesman Vishnu Prakash told reporters.


 He said Indian officials had seen media reports on the statements
made by Pakistan's interior minister Rahman Malik.
