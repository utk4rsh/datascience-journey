
'A thank you' is all that families of the 7/11 victims want to say to the many
faceless people who went out of their way to help the victims at the blast
sites. 

 Moved by the rush of
people that poured in to help after Parag Karambelkar was injured in the Mahim
blast, his wife Shubhashree wants to express her gratitude. Shubhashree has been
interacting with the families of other victims to know how they can thank the
people at large for helping the blast victims.


 "My husband was taken to Sion
hospital by some strangers. I want to thank all those who helped him and others
at the site. I am also interacting with other families to find out how we can do
it," she said. 

 Soon after the
seven blasts, commuters and locals came to the aid of the victims. A number of
families were greeted by unknown people who had travelled to their homes to
deliver goods and belongings of the victims.


 Sunita Pawar, whose husband
Suresh Pawar was killed in the blast, is grateful to the Western Railway for
giving her a job as she needs to support her two school-going children. Having
received the required help to support her family, Sunita wants to thank those
who helped the victims. 

 "For
me a job was of prime importance as I have a family to support. But I feel a
sense of gratitude to the people who helped the victims and also came forward to
help their families," said Sunita, who has also received a cheque worth Rs 2
lakh from the Indian Merchants Chamber.


 The families of the 186 dead
victims have been provided with an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh from WR and Rs 1 lakh
from the state government. In addition, a kin of each of these dead victims have
been promised a 'group D' job in the WR.


 Dharmista Shah, who lost her
husband Shubhash Shah (54) in the Mahim railway station blast is still looking
for the good Samaritans who helped her husband at the blast site.
