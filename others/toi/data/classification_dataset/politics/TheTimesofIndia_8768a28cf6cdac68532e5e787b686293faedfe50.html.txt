
Ishaan Parasnath thinks his father has gone to Chennai on work and hence
couldn't make it for his seventh birthday on July 15.


 Though three weeks have passed
since the July 11 serial blasts, in which his father Krishna Kumar Parasnath
(33) was killed at Khar station, Ishaan's family still can't bring themselves to
tell him his father has died.


 Furthermore, his mother Anju
Parasnath is in the seventh month of another pregnancy.


 Her brother Manish Kumar has
taken her and Ishaan to his house at Powai, because the Raheja Complex house in
Malad (East) where they lived will have to be surrendered to the Indian Overseas
Bank, where Krishna worked as an assistant manager.


 Says Manish, "Krishna was the
breadwinner of the family. Every month he would even send money to our aged
parents in Bihar. With his death, life has come to a standstill for Anju, who
now wants to take up a job as soon as possible."


 Anju, a first-class botany
graduate who was happy in her housewife's role, will have to wait to deliver her
child before she sets about looking for a job.
