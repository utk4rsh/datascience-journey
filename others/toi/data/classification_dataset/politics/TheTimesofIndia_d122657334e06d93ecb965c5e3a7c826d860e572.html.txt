 South Asia was in the midst of an "unprecedented" economic and political
transformation and governments of the region were working together to address
the issues.

 Inaugurating the
14th South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in the Capital,
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that the political transformation is
painful.

 "Each one of us has to
work out for ourselves and within our countries and between our governments,"
Singh said.

 He said as an
immediate step, "I propose that we link all our capitals through direct
flights". 

 He also announced
unilateral liberalisation of visa policy for students, teachers, researchers,
journalists and patients. 

 The
Prime Minister also announced duty-free access to Indian markets to "our South
Asian neighbours without insisting on reciprocity".


 Singh was unanimously elected
as the new chairperson of the eight-nation SAARC on Tuesday.
