
India on Sunday said the decision to set up the anti-terrorism institutional
mechanism has made possible the resumption of dialogue process with Pakistan and
that it can take up all issues including the long-standing demand for
extradition of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim and Hizbul leader Syed Salahuddin,
both residing in that
country.

 However, New Delhi
turned down suggestions that there has been a 'shift' in its stance in
acknowledging that Pakistan is a victim of terrorism and made it clear that
there cannot be a guarantee that all kinds of terrorist acts would come to an
end with the setting up of the
mechanism.

 It also denied that
it had blamed Pakistan for the serial blasts in Mumbai and said investigations
were still on.

 Replying to a
volley of questions on the issue of mechanism that will identify and implement
counter-terrorism initiatives and investigations, contained in the joint press
statement of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Pervez Musharraf on
Saturday, Foreign Secretary-designate P Shivshankar Menon told journalists that
"this is a new (step). We have not done this before with Pakistan. We have had
discussions but not in terms of an institutional mechanism. It is
new.

 "And that is what has made
it possible to resume the dialogue, take the peace process forward and we see
this seems to be the way forward with Pakistan. This is new. It's functions are
clear. We have got the mandate. It is to identify the kind of terrorism and
organisations. We think it is a broad mandate. What it will be, is for the two
sides to discuss and implement it."
