 The
manifesto, released by CPI General Secretary AB Bardhan here, said its aim is to
"halt the ruling classes from pursuing a disastrous course" like the neo-liberal
policies of the Congress and BJP's "communal agenda". 

 "The CPI and
the Left is joining the electoral battle with the slogan of providing a
non-Congress and non-BJP alternative that should carry forward the glorious
tradition of anti-imperialism, secular polity and independent economic policies
and social justice to all," the manifesto said. 

 The manifesto also
called for a larger presence of the CPI and Left as a whole in 15th Lok
Sabha.
