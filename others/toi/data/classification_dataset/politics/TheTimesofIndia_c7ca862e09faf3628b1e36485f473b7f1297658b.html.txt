 A blanket ban on junk food and colas in school and university canteens
countrywide and mandatory yoga classes in schools — that’s Union
health minister A Ramadoss’s prescription to fight rising obesity among
India’s youth. 

 "Colas
with or without pesticides are harmful for health and should not be consumed. We
want all forms of junk food like pizzas, chips, samosas and burgers banned from
canteens," Ramadoss said here on Thursday on the sidelines of a conference on
nutrition.

 And, it’s not
merely a statement of intent. The minister is aggressively pushing the proposal.
He has written to state health ministers, asking them to plan and implement the
ban on junk food — seen as one of the main causes of the rise in heart
disease, diabetes and cancer among India’s 300-milion-strong, and
increasingly wealthy, middle
class.

 The minister now plans
to write to vice-chancellors of leading universities asking them to implement
the ban on their campuses.

 He
will meet his HRD counterpart, Arjun Singh, shortly to finalise a proposal to
make health and lifestyle classes mandatory in schools.


 "We want to introduce health
as a subject in schools, to be taught bi-weekly. We plan to enlighten the
younger generation about diseases and a healthy lifestyle. They should know what
to eat and what to avoid, how much to exercise, what type of lifestyle is best
for them, how will it help their health besides being aware of diseases like
HIV/AIDS," Ramadoss said.
