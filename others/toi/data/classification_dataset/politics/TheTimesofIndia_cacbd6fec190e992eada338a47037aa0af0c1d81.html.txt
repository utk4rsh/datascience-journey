 India on Sunday said it will give evidence to Pakistan about the
involvement of ISI and Pakistan-based terror groups in the Mumbai blasts and
judge the country by its actions and not words.


 Taking charge as Foreign
Secretary, Shiv Shankar Menon questioned how Pakistan can deny involvement of
ISI and Pakistan-based terror groups without looking at
evidence.

 He said India will
give evidence to Pakistan and "judge it by its actions and not words".


 Mumbai Police on Saturday
blamed ISI for masterminding the July 11 train serial blasts which, they said,
were executed by activists of outlawed Lashkar-e-Toiba and
SIMI.

 Menon, a 1972 batch IFS
officer, took over from Shyam Saran who has been appointed Special Envoy for
negotiations relating to the Indo-US civil nuclear deal after his
retirement.

 On the civil
nuclear deal, Menon said it enjoyed bipartisan support in the the US and hoped
for early passage of the bill by the Congress.
