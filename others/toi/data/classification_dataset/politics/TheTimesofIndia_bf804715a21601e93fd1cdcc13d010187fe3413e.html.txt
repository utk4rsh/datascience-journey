
Pakistan termed the Mumbai police findings that ISI masterminded the July 11
train blasts as "baseless and fabricated" and said it was aimed at maligning the
country.

 "The allegations are
totally baseless and fabricated," Interior Minister Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao
told media while reacting to Mumbai police's
claims.

 "We totally reject it
as it is aimed at maligning Pakistan at a time when leadership of the two
countries met in Havana and such baseless allegations are not going to help," he
said.

 While Pakistan Foreign
Office was yet to react, Minister of State for Information Tariq Azam rejected
the claim and said that India could provide any evidence it has to Pakistan to
investigate.

 The Mumbai police
disclosures came as President Pervez Musharraf returned home on Saturday from an
18-day tour during which he visited Brussels, Havana, the US and UK.
