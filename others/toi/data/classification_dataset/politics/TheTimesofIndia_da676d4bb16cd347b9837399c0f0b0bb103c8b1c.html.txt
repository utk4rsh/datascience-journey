
The India-Pakistan institutional mechanism on terrorism, set up on Saturday by
PM Manmohan Singh and President Pervez Musharraf, was the vital breakthrough in
their talks that allowed, according to foreign secretary-designate Shiv Shankar
Menon, the "resumption of dialogue" between the estranged
neighbours.

 Yet, hours after PM
announced its setting up, few were wiser as to what the mechanism meant. New
Delhi, which has so far held ISI, an organ of the Pakistan government, as a
sponsor of terror groups operating from Pakistani soil, is now ready to join
hands with Islamabad to counter the menace. Does it mean a shift in
India’s position on the source and support infrastructure of
terror?

 The buzz was loud
enough for Menon to reach the media hotel late on Saturday evening to try and
clear the air. Despite repeated questions, he maintained that there has been no
shift in India’s stance on terror. Though he seemed clear that the
experiment deserved a try, he stonewalled questions by reiterating what the
joint statement states: the mechanism will "identify and implement
counter-terrorism initiatives and
investigations".

 Menon’s
tactic was understandable as a shift in India’s stance on terrorism
vis-a-vis Pakistan has strong implications for politics back home. Already BJP
has criticised the alleged shift, describing it as unwarranted softness towards
Pakistan. Menon defended the mechanism, saying "we can’t go back in time",
while maintaining the two sides were "breaking new ground" to tackle
terrorism.

 Asked how India,
which had blamed Pakistan immediately after the Mumbai bomb blasts, was now
joining hands with it to fight terrorism, Menon denied that India had ever
blamed its western neighbour for the blasts. ‘‘Government of India
didn’t blame Pakistan," he said. "Government is still investigating the
blasts. Our stance is that we need to tackle terrorism, whatever the
source."
