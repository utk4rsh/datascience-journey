 The local administration
on Thursday started evacuating people from low-lying areas of four districts in
Orissa as the Mahanadi river was flowing above the danger level following
incessant rains.

 An official said with the incessant rain lashing
Orissa and Chhattisgarh for the last five days, an estimated 16 lakh cusecs of
water would pass through the Mahanadi near Cuttack by Friday.


 ‘‘This is likely to submerge vast areas in Cuttack,
Puri, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapada and Bhadrak districts,’’ he said.


 He said schools in the region have been closed for three days from
Friday and teachers ordered to help in the relief and rescue operations.
