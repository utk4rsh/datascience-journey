 NC,
which has got 28 seats, exactly the same number that it had in the dissolved
Assembly, said it will approach "like minded" Congress, which bagged 17 seats,
for forming the next government after the five-week seven-phased polls that
recorded a high 61 per cent turn-out defying separatists' boycott calls and
militant guns. The Congress lost three seats. 

 Back-channel talks
have already begun between the two parties, sources said, adding Congress
general secretary Rahul Gandhi, who is said to have good equations with Omar, is
expected to play a key role in forging a partnership. 

 An NC-Congress
combine can cross the magic half-way mark of 44 in a House of 87 but there there
are six independents besides the three-member Panthers Party from whom it could
also count on for support. 

 The PDP, which shared power with Congress
on a rotational basis for last six years, came second with a tally of 21 seats,
a gain of five over the 2002 elections. 

 Cashing in on the Amarnath
land row, the BJP put up an impressive performance clinching 11 of the 37 seats
at stake in Jammu region. The saffron party had only one seat in the last
Assembly. The CPI-M could only win one of the two seats it had. 

 The
38-year-old Omar Abdullah, the scion of the Abdullah family, who steered NC for
a shot at power, said his party would approach the Congress for forming the next
government.
