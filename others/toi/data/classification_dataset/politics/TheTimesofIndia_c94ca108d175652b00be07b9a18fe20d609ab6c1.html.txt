 "Going back to a 9 percent growth path is our greatest
challenge. For this, we will take whatever steps that are required," the prime
minister said in his Independence Day address to the nation from the majestic
Red Fort. 

 "By the end of the year, I am confident there will be a
major change. But till then, we all have to cope with the situation," he said in
his sixth straight address laying down the agenda for the United Progressive
Alliance (UPA) government in the coming year. 

 "I appeal to business
leaders to work together in this endeavour and meet their social obligations and
responsibilities." 

 According to Manmohan Singh, it was because of
his government's policies that the country was able to grow at 6.7 percent in
the last fiscal when the world was facing one of the worst downturns in eight
decades. 

 He said steps will be taken to ensure adequate spending on
development projects to boost growth further and capital will be sought not only
from domestic sources but from overseas as well. 

 "India can progress
only when each Indian makes a contribution. Our endeavour has been to reach the
fruits of development to every citizen. I know we have a long way to go."


 The prime minister said he was also aware that high commodity prices
were causing hardship to citizens, especially the poor. "We have enough food
stocks. Every possible step will be taken to bring down prices," he said.


 At the same time, he appealed to all state governments to use all
administrative and legislative measures at their disposal to ensure that prices
of essential commodities like cereals an pulses are brought down.
