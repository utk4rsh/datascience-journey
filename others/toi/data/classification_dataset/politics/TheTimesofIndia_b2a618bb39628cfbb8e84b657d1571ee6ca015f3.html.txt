
The General hung back just a bit. Manmohan Singh had left after reading out the
joint statement without entertaining any questions — as had been agreed by
the two sides — but Musharraf was still there at the entrance of Hotel
Palco when Indian journalists reached
there.

 It’s difficult for
the man to resist the media. Looking beyond Pakistan foreign minister Kasuri and
other officials, Musharraf smiled mysteriously. A question was popped, "General
sa’ab, how were the talks?" He swiftly brought his forefinger to his lips,
which were pursed in a mischievous smile. “I have been told not to talk to
the media, at least not
today."

 But surely he would say
something? “Mohabbat zindabad!” he said, raising his fist. There
were smiles all around. Would he call the talks a breakthrough? “Yes...the
talks were very good. You know, I am always ready to talk to you, but today I
can’t. I must respect the understanding.”
