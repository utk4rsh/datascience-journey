 India will shortly present to Pakistan the names of its nationals
suspected to be involved in the deadly Mumbai blasts along with related evidence
through the joint anti-terror mechanism recently agreed upon, highly placed
sources said on Wednesday.

 As
many as 11 Pakistani nationals were directly involved in the serial blasts on
July 11 in which nearly 200 people died, according to the Mumbai police which
said that the attacks were planned by ISI in Pakistan and carried out by
Lashkar-e-Toiba with the help of the banned Islamic Students Movement of India
(SIMI).

 Two of the Pakistanis
involved are dead but the remaining are believed to have escaped to their
country or could be hiding in
India.

 LeT's commander in
Pakistan's Bahawalput district, Azam Cheema is suspected to be the brain behind
the conspiracy. Islamabad's rejection of the Mumbai police claims and its
refusal to handover any suspects to India is unacceptable to New Delhi which
wants this case to be the first test for the joint
mechanism.

 As Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh said on his way back home from South Africa, the evidence of
Pakistani involvement will be offered to Islamabad through the joint mechanism
and it would be ascertained "how sincere they are in carrying forward the
commitment I and President Musharraf have underlined" in the joint statement
from Havana.

 The Prime Minister
left no one in doubt that the evidence India gives to Pakistan would be a test
of its sincerity in controlling
terrorism.

 "Pakistan will have
to walk the talk", he asserted. "Whatever has been discovered (by Mumbai
police), we shall share that information with Pakistan", he told reporters,
adding "we will test the
water".

 There was condemnation
of the Mumbai blasts in the joint statement and also an explicit mention that
the two countries will work to control the menace of terrorism, he
recalled.
