
The Kerala High Court on Friday refused to stay the state government order
banning the manufacture and sale of Coca Cola and
Pepsi.

 A division bench,
comprising Chief Justice VK Bali and Justice M Ramachandran, posted the case for
final hearing on September
11.

 Even though the counsels of
the two soft drinks majors, Coca Cola and PepsiCo, insisted for an interim stay
order, the bench said the matter will be finally decided after hearing all the
parties.

 In separate petitions
the Hindustan Coca Cola Beverages Ltd and Pepsi India Holdings Private Ltd had
sought quashing the state government's ban order of August 10 and order of the
Director of Health Services of August 11.


 They also wanted a direction
prohibiting the state government from taking action against them.
