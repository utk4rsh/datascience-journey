
 CHENNAI/NEW
DELHI: The political class seemed to be getting ready for a fight with the
judiciary over the Supreme Courtâ€™s order extending creamy layer to SC/STs
and its insistence on the inviolability of the 50% ceiling on quota, even as the
OBC establishment sought to rally forces for a
showdown.

 The call to arms came
from the OBC patriarch, Tamil Nadu chief minister K Karunanidhi. He asked for a
mobilisation of forces against the SC order, which he termed a "setback".


 The veteran leader asked the
states to implead themselves in the case regarding whether all laws put in the
9th Schedule enjoyed immunity from judicial scrutiny and seek its referral to a
13-judge bench.

 The 9th
Schedule case, set to be taken up by a 9-judge constitution bench on October 30,
has gained a significant dimension in view of the quota controversy. There are
indications that the government may incorporate in the Schedule quota-related
laws which the judiciary has frowned upon to inoculate them from legal
scrutiny.

 "You are all aware
that there is a setback caused to reservation by certain judgments of the
Supreme Court. Now the matter is being taken for consideration by a nine-member
constitutional bench of the court. Any law enacted and brought under Schedule
Nine is also under attack," he said in letters to CMs.


 The TN chief minister argued
that all states have a compelling reason to oppose this trend against
reservation and social justice, and wanted the case to be referred to a larger
bench.
