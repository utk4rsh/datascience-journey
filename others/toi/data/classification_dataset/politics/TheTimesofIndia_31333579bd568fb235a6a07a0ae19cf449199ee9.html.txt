 BJP on Thursday took objection to Union Minister P R Dasmunsi's comments
on senior BJP leader L K Advani's demand for bestowing Bharat Ratna on former
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.


 "It is a communication between
the Leader of the Opposition and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. What does a
union minister have to do with it," party spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy told
reporters here on Thursday.


 He(Dasmunsi) does not deserve
to comment on such issues, he added.


 In a letter to the Prime
Minister, Advani had proposed Vajpayee's name for the nation's highest civilian
award for his contribution to the national life and for strengthening democracy
both when he was in power and when he was out of it.


 Dasmunsi on Thursday, speaking
to reporters here, said he did not know why Advani had written such a letter,
but felt that had the Leader of Opposition honoured Vajpayee within the party,
it would have been much better.


 "Such matters are not decided
though letters," he said. He said many people write seeking honours like Padma
Shri and Padma Bhushan, but there was an appropriate committee at the Centre to
decide on such issues.
