 After senior BJP leader
proposed former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's name for Bharat Ratna, the
CPM on Friday  said party patriarch Jyoti Basu can be given the honour if he
fulfils the parameters.

 Asked whether Basu should be awarded the
Bharat Ratna, CPI(M) politburo member Biman Bose told reporters here that


 "I don't know whether Basu fulfils the parameters. If he fulfills it, Basu
can be given the highest civilian award." Bose flayed senior BJP leader L K
Advani writing to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh proposing the honour for
Vajpayee saying the saffron party was "playing politics" with the country's
highest civilian award. 

 "I don't know the parameters under which
Bharat Ratna is awarded or whether Vajpayee fulfils that criteria. But it is
definite that they are doing politics over it," Bose said.

 While,
seeking a way out of the inconvenient question of a Bharat Ratna for former PM
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Congress too  sought to pit the veteran Marxist's name
against the BJP stalwart for the highest civilian award. Replying to a question
about Basu, senior Congress leader Veerappa Moily said, "He is a great leader
also."

 Clearly Congress is in a dilemma since it can neither
summarily sweep away Vajpayee as an aspirant nor agree to his nomination for the
Bharat Ratna.

 PM Manmohan Singh too sounded evasive when asked about
BJP leader L K Advani's letter to him proposing Vajpayee's name. 

 "It
is too early; there is time to decide this issue," Singh said replying to
reporters' questions. The question came at a press conference he jointly
addressed with Greek prime minister Kostas Karamanlis. I&B minister P R
Dasmunsi had earlier said that "it is not in the tradition to communicate
through letters about such matters."
