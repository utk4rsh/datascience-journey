 Bihar Government has decided to
increase the corpus of the contingency fund from Rs 350 crore to Rs 2500 crore
to tackle the devastation caused by the floods. 

 "We have decided to
raise the contingency fund corpus from Rs 350 crore to Rs 2500 crore to meet the
needs of the victims of the deluge in worst-hit districts of Saharsa, Supaul,
Madhepura, Araria and Purnia," Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi
said.

 According to an official, who wished not to be named, the
proposal was likely to be presented before the cabinet for approval later this
evening. 

 Giving the much needed respite to the businessmen of the
affected areas, the state government has also resolved to extend the deadline by
a month for filing Value Added Tax (VAT) returns for the month of August which
expires on September 30. 

 "The businessmen of flood affected
districts of Saharsa, Supaul, Madhepura, Araria, Purnia and Naugachhia
sub-division in Bhagalpur district have been given time till October 30 to file
their VAT returns," Modi said. 

 The government has also waived
revenue collection from Fishermen Cooperative Societies during the floods.
