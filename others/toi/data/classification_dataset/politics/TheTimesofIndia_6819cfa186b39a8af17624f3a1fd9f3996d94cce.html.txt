 A section of doctors in a leading hospital here are on hunger strike on
Friday to protest against reservation of seats in educational institutions but
pledged not to make life difficult for
patients.

 Worried over the
clearance of the quota Bill by the Lok Sabha on Thursday, 15 resident doctors of
the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) started the hunger strike in
the campus.

 "Our protest
against injustice will continue. Currently, only 15 doctors are on hunger
strike. The situation will be reviewed later," said Anil Sharma, the
representative of resident doctors at
AIIMS.

 He promised not to let
patients suffer.

 Sharma said
they were in touch with resident doctors of other medical colleges in Delhi and
added that 1,200 doctors would meet on Friday evening to decide their future
course of action.

 However, some
patients said they were ready for the worst and would leave AIIMS if services
got paralysed.

 "We know about
the problems patients faced in May. We are ready to move out in an emergency,"
said Rajesh Kalra from Ghaziabad.


 Kalra, whose mother is
suffering from kidney problems, said it was better to leave the hospital rather
than stay unattended.

 Health
services in the capital's state-run hospitals were crippled in May when hundreds
of doctors took a two-week leave to protest the central government's proposal to
reserve 27 percent seats in higher educational institutions across India for
other backward classes (OBCs).


 Nearly 8,000 people avail of
medical care at AIIMS every day. Of them, 6,000 are treated through outpatient
departments.
