
 Given
a chance, women can certainly play a great role in ensuring South Asian
cooperation, said Gursharan Kaur, wife of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, at a
lunch she hosted in honour of Saarc wives in New Delhi on Wednesday.


 It would not just help reduce
the burden on the men but also ensure that women's talent is appropriately used,
she observed. 

 This, however,
was offline, and not the topic of conversation at the table that seated
Gursharan Kaur and the wives of heads of delegation of Saarc member countries.


 "We didn't discuss anything
that serious," Gursharan revealed with an endearing smile. Talk between the
Saarc ladies revolved around cultural and ethnic differences between their
countries and veered around to even families and children.


 Not that there was much time
to talk while delectable food, selected and sampled by Gursharan herself, was
being served and the carefully chosen entertainment programme was in progress.


 If the Saarc ladies were
stirred by the performance of the world's only professional lady tabla player,
Anuradha Pal, and her percussion ensemble 'Stree Shakti', they were mesmerised
by Ritu Kumar's display of rich Indian textiles and history of craftsmanship.


 From food to music to crafts,
the theme was the diversity of Indian tradition. From Amritsari 'kulchas' to
Delhi 'chaat', Mumbai 'bhel', Kolkata 'kamal bhog' and Malabar curries, the
cuisine was a pick from the best the country had to offer.


 'Stree Shakti', Asia's most
celebrated all-woman group that challenges the male-dominated Indian music
scene, brought together music from north and south.


 Ritu Kumar's 'Tree of Life'
represented, in Ritu's words, the thread that binds the country. Stylistically,
textiles may change from region to region, and craft and skill-sets are diverse,
but 'Indian textile' is almost like a tree that holds all aesthetic variations
together, explained the designer.
