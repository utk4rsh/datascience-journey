 The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to grant any interim relief to the
Kerala government, which had challenged the Kerala High Court's decision to lift
a ban imposed on sale of Pepsi and Coca-Cola in the
state.

 A Bench comprising
Justice A R Lakshman and Justice Altmas Kabir, however, issued notices to
Pepsico India Holdings Ltd and Hindustan Coca-Cola Pvt Ltd and asked them to
file replies in four weeks.

 A
division bench of the Kerala High Court had, on September 22 last year, held
that the state was not empowered to prohibit the manufacture and sale of these
cola drinks.

 The Kerala
government had in August 2006 notified the ban on these products following
findings by NGO Centre for Science and Environment that the drinks contained
pesticide residues beyond the permissible level and were not fit for human
consumption.
