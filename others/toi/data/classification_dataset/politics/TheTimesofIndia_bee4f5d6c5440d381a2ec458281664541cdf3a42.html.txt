 Another CD on the cash-for-vote episode surfaced on Monday with three UPA
parties claiming that the BJP had stage managed the entire show for political
gains. 

 "All the claims of BJP
leaders have been proved wrong," SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav said while
releasing the CD at a joint press conference with RJD and LJP leaders Lalu
Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan here.


 "When some people visited the
BJP MP's house to deliver money why was it not handed over to police.
Fingerprinting tests could have led to some evidence," he said.


 The entire incident was
"cooked up" by the BJP to make it a poll issue in the next elections. The total
number of CDs in circulation on cash-for-vote scandal has now gone up to three.


 Paswan also said the entire
episode was a drama enacted by the BJP.

 On Sunday, BJP general
secretary Arun Jaitley made public transcripts of the conversation recorded by
the "sting" as well as call details of the mobile phone of Amar Singh's personal
aide.

 He also
said that the records of cell towers on July 22 corroborated the movement of
Saxena from Amar Singh's official residence to Argal's Ferozeshah Road house.
